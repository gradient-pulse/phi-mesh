# Word→Pixel (W→P)

**Core idea:** Words → Gradients → Reality (Pixels)

- **Words** (YAML pulses, prose) encode tensions.
- **Gradients** (Δ) organize into Gradient Choreographies (GC) and, when resonant, form Contextual Filters (CF).
- **Reality (Pixels):** We render that structure directly—minimal, schematic visuals that show the shape of coherence.

## Scope (MVP)
- **Input:** one YAML pulse.
- **Translate:** extract Δ/GC/CF (when present) or use pulse sections/headings.
- **Output:** 
  - `PNG` — black background, white text/lines, tiny Φ-Mesh tag.
  - `MD` — exact text appearing in the image (for parsing).

## Constraints
- No illustration; **structural syntax only**.
- Minimal text (3–4 words per bullet).
- Black/white only.
- Two aspect ratios when needed (16:9 for X, 1:1 for LinkedIn).

## Success criteria
- A viewer can infer relationships (flows, resonance, balance) **without** reading the pulse.
- The MD text is sufficient to reconstruct the visual programmatically.
- Adding Δ/GC/CF later does not break the format.

## Layout guide (default)
- Title (centered, uppercase)
- Optional tagline (one short line)
- Two or more blocks with bullets
- Central divider or icon if expressing balance
- Tiny Φ-Mesh tag (bottom-right)
