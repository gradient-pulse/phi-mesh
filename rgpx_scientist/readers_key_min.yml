  title: "RGPx Reader’s Key (Minimal)"
  purpose: >
    Translation-only decoder ring for RGPx/Mesh terms. Use to explain terms in plain,
    testable language. Not evidence. Do not cite as mechanism support.

  use_rules:
    - Use this file only to translate terms and standardize wording.
    - Do not use this file to justify mechanism claims; evidence must come from pulses.
    - If a Mesh term appears in sections (1)–(5), append a one-line testable translation immediately.
    - Prefer spelled-out terms over acronyms unless the user explicitly asks for abbreviations.

  claim_strength_labels:
    definition:
      meaning: "What a term means (vocabulary)."
      allowed_sources: ["tag_taxonomy.yml", "tag_descriptions.yml", "readers_key_min.yml"]
    hypothesis:
      meaning: "Mechanism proposal not established."
      marking: "uncited (domain background) unless supported by pulses."
    prediction:
      meaning: "Falsifiable expected pattern."
      requirement: "Specify what is measured and what outcome would falsify it."
    evidence:
      meaning: "Supported by retrieved pulse citations in section (6)."
      requirement: "Pulse excerpt(s) ≤20 words each."

  core_translation:
    mesh_form: "Δ→GC→CF"
    plain_translation: "small effect appears → repeats reliably → stays stable under context changes"
    test_note: "Perturb context; if the repeated pattern persists, stabilization is present."

  metric_plus_morphology:
    mesh_form: "metric + morphology-sensitive diagnostics"
    plain_translation: "standard summary measures plus shape/organization measures"
    test_note: "Compare cohort separation using metric-only versus metric-plus-morphology under identical controls."

  essential_terms:
    rgpx:
      plain_definition: "Recursive Gradient Physics: a research framework for tracking how stable organization forms from differences under feedback."
      testable_one_liner: "If organization is real, it persists under perturbation better than matched controls."
    coherence:
      plain_definition: "persistence of organized relationships under perturbation"
      testable_one_liner: "Apply a controlled perturbation; quantify how much structure survives vs baseline drift."
    gradient:
      plain_definition: "a measurable local difference/tension in a variable"
      testable_one_liner: "Change the difference; check for consistent, directional response change."
    gradient_choreography:
      plain_definition: "a repeatable pattern formed by interacting differences over time"
      testable_one_liner: "Across runs, the pattern recurs above chance and survives mild perturbations."
    contextual_filter:
      plain_definition: "a boundary/constraint that selects which patterns persist under context change"
      testable_one_liner: "Vary context; if the same pattern persists, a stabilizing filter is acting."
    operational_advantage:
      plain_definition: "a method-level improvement in discrimination, prediction, or stability under the same data and controls"
      testable_one_liner: "Hold data and controls fixed; if the extended method performs better, it has operational advantage."
    pre_metric:
      plain_definition: "a morphology-first descriptive layer that analyzes organization before reducing to standard summary metrics"
      testable_one_liner: "If pre-metric observables add value, they improve cohort discrimination beyond metric-only summaries."
    phi:
      plain_definition: "a chosen scalar metric of persistence (must be defined per experiment)"
      requirement_when_used:
        - "Define Φ explicitly: what is measured"
        - "Specify how Φ is computed"
        - "State the perturbation test and falsification rule"
