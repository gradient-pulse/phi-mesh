  title: "RGPx Reader’s Key"
  purpose: >
    Translation-only decoder ring: maps RGPx/Mesh terms to plain scientific language,
    with testable one-liners. This file MUST NOT overwrite or “improve” tags or pulses.
  use_rules:
    - Use this file only to translate terms, define claim-strength labels, and standardize wording.
    - Do not cite this file as mechanism evidence; it is a vocabulary/translation aid only.
    - When a Mesh term appears in sections (1)–(5), immediately append its testable translation (one line).
    - Prefer spelled-out terms over acronyms unless user explicitly asked for abbreviations.
    - Avoid metaphysical framing; treat all terms as operational and testable.
    - If a claim needs evidence, cite pulses (preferred) or mark "uncited (domain background)".

claim_strength_labels:
  definition:
    meaning: "Term definition or naming convention (what we mean by the word)."
    allowed_sources: ["tag_taxonomy.yml", "tag_descriptions.yml", "readers_key.yml"]
  hypothesis:
    meaning: "Proposed mechanism or cross-domain mapping not yet established."
    required_marking: "uncited (domain background) unless supported by pulse evidence."
  prediction:
    meaning: "A measurable expected pattern under specified conditions."
    required: "Must specify what is measured and how it would falsify the claim."
  evidence:
    meaning: "Supported by retrieved pulses and verbatim excerpts in section (6)."
    required: "Pulse citation(s) in section (6) with ≤20-word excerpts."

translation_patterns:

    mesh_form: "Δ→GC→CF"
    plain_translation: "small effect appears → repeats reliably → stays stable under context changes"

  coherence_as_persistence:
    mesh_form: "coherence"
    plain_translation: "persistence of organized relationships under perturbation"

glossary:
  rgpx:
    mesh_term: "RGPx"
    plain_definition: "Recursive Gradient Physics: a research framework for tracking how stable organization forms from differences under feedback."
    testable_one_liner: "If organization is real, it persists under perturbation better than matched controls."
  mesh:
    mesh_term: "Φ-Mesh / Mesh"
    plain_definition: "Repository + tag map + pulses: a traceable record of claims, tests, and updates."

  tag:
    mesh_term: "tag"
    plain_definition: "A concept label used as an index coordinate."
    testable_one_liner: "A tag is not evidence; it is a pointer to definitions and pulses."
  pulse:
    mesh_term: "pulse"
    plain_definition: "A dated research entry describing an observation, test, outcome, and limits."
    testable_one_liner: "A pulse earns ‘evidence’ status only if it includes a discriminating test and outcome."
  gradient:
    mesh_term: "gradient (Δ)"
    plain_definition: "A local difference/tension that can drive change (in a measurable variable)."
    testable_one_liner: "If Δ matters, changing Δ changes the system response in a consistent direction."
  gradient_choreography:
    mesh_term: "gradient choreography"
    plain_definition: "A repeatable pattern formed by interacting differences over time."
    testable_one_liner: "A choreography repeats across runs more than chance and survives mild perturbations."
  contextual_filter:
    mesh_term: "contextual filter"
    plain_definition: "A boundary/constraint that selects which patterns persist under context change."
    testable_one_liner: "Change context: if the same pattern persists, a stabilizing filter is present."
  coherence:
    mesh_term: "coherence"
    plain_definition: "Persistence of organized relationships (structure/meaning/function) under perturbation."
    testable_one_liner: "Perturb the system: measure how much of the structure survives vs. baseline."
  coherence_flux:
    mesh_term: "coherence flux"
    plain_definition: "Rate of change of persistence (how quickly stability is gained or lost)."
    testable_one_liner: "Compute stability over time; compare slopes across conditions/interventions."
  coherence_grammar:
    mesh_term: "coherence grammar"
    plain_definition: "A recurring sequence of formation → repetition → stabilization observed across domains."
    testable_one_liner: "Look for the same 3-phase structure across independent datasets and contexts."
  phi:
    mesh_term: "Φ"
    plain_definition: "A placeholder name for a chosen scalar metric of persistence (must be defined per experiment)."
    testable_one_liner: "Define Φ explicitly (what is counted); then test whether Φ is stable under perturbation."
    required_fields_when_used:
      - "Φ_definition: what is measured"
      - "Φ_units_or_scale: unitless / ratio / score"
      - "Φ_protocol: how computed (inputs, window, threshold)"
  phi_corridor:
    mesh_term: "Φ corridor"
    plain_definition: "An empirically observed stability band for Φ under specified perturbations."
    testable_one_liner: "Define corridor bounds from baseline; test if intervention keeps Φ within bounds."
  plateau:
    mesh_term: "plateau"
    plain_definition: "A regime where improvement stalls or stability saturates despite further tuning."
    testable_one_liner: "Change control parameters: if output stays flat within error, you’re in a plateau."
  phase_locking:
    mesh_term: "phase locking"
    plain_definition: "Synchronization of repeating cycles across components or runs."
    testable_one_liner: "Measure alignment of cycle timing across runs; compare to randomized controls."
  harmonics_123:
    mesh_term: "1:2:3 harmonics"
    plain_definition: "A proposed ratio pattern in measured cycles (must be specified and tested, not asserted)."
    testable_one_liner: "Define the signals; test whether peaks occur at ~1x, ~2x, ~3x more than chance."
    default_status: "hypothesis"
  context_drift:
    mesh_term: "context drift"
    plain_definition: "Loss of stable interpretation/behavior as context changes."
    testable_one_liner: "Change prompts/conditions: quantify output stability vs. baseline variance."
  minimal_discriminating_test:
    mesh_term: "minimal discriminating test"
    plain_definition: "Smallest experiment that separates 2–4 competing explanations."
    testable_one_liner: "One intervention + one measurement that yields opposite predictions across hypotheses."

    This file is a decoder ring for terminology and test structure.
    It is not a source of evidence. Evidence must come from retrieved pulses.
