      - claim_id: gradient_capitalism_2025_12_07__c14_antitrust_reframed_as_saturation_management
        claim: "Antitrust is reframed as preventing regions where J≈J* and D(J)→0 from hardening into permanent extraction wells, rather than focusing on prices/market share."
        claim_type: reframing
        test_hook: "Compare two antitrust scoring rules on historical cases: (i) price/share, (ii) saturation+diffusion; test which better predicts later fragility and innovation decline."

      - claim_id: gradient_capitalism_2025_12_07__c15_taxation_and_redistribution_as_stability_tools
        claim: "Taxation/redistribution add a stability dimension: raising diffusion and reducing overshoot toward J* is framed as a core objective."
        claim_type: policy_claim
        test_hook: "Test whether redistributive policies correlate with higher ‘diffusion proxies’ (mobility, entry rates, network connectivity) and lower cascade risk, controlling for GDP growth."
        evidence_excerpt: "Coherence adds a third dimension: stability."

      - claim_id: gradient_capitalism_2025_12_07__c16_central_banks_should_track_coherence_dashboard
        claim: "Central banks/treasuries are urged to publish a coherence dashboard (including J(t), diffusion, concentration, plateau proximity) and operate as coherence filters, not just inflation managers."
        claim_type: governance_proposal
        test_hook: "Construct a prototype dashboard using public financial-network proxies; test whether it improves early-warning lead time vs CPI-only monitoring."
        evidence_excerpt: "Central banks and treasuries should publish a coherence dashboard: J(t), diffusion indicators, concentration indices, and plateau proximity."

      - claim_id: gradient_capitalism_2025_12_07__c17_economy_drawn_to_coherence_fixed_points
        claim: "The paper suggests the economy may be drawn toward stable coherence fixed points, analogous to attractors in nature."
        claim_type: hypothesis
        test_hook: "Define candidate fixed-point indicators (plateau values, bounded variance) and test whether disparate economies/eras converge to similar ‘plateau signatures’ after normalization."
        evidence_excerpt: "the economy, like nature, may be drawn toward stable coherence fixed points."
