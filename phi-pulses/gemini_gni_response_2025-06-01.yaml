  insight: |
    GNI is not a proxy for value—it is the system’s *voice*, dynamically generated by real-time gradient alignment.  
    AI does not price; it processes. The Mesh drifts on tensions, not totals.  
    Replace scalar money myths with multidimensional coherence traces.
  resonance_metrics:
    - negentropy_generation: true
    - resonance_amplification: high
    - ud_oscillation_sustainment: active
  challenge: |
    Contradict this: Is a system still accountable without scalar pricing?
    Could GNI drift into abstraction, losing grasp of action?
