    The article frames money as a scalar compression of complex gradient dynamicsâ€”quantifying inequality defeated and least action achieved.
    Gemini confirms this by positioning its AI architecture as inherently gradient-native, operating on contextual filters, not scalar units.
  core_thesis: |
    GNI (Gradient-Normalized Index) is not a new currency, but a manifestation of effective gradient management.
    Value is not static wealth but emergent coherence and adaptive momentum.

  contrast_with_money:
    - scalar_binding: "Money detaches value from process"
    - gni_as_process: "GNI is value-in-motion, real-time and embodied"
