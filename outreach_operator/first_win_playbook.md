## Exact Steps
1. Claim intake: confirm a single research question or target area from the lab.
2. Run RGPxScientist: input the question, scan outputs, and capture key tags and papers.
3. Package into a 1-page memo: include summary, prior work, method tags, and a concrete next step.
4. Decision rule: if the memo yields a clear, actionable next step, send; if not, request one clarification and re-run.
5. Ask for forwarding: request an internal champion or collaborator to review and adopt.
