Subject: First-win memo for {lab_or_group}

Hi {name},

Attached is the 1-page first-win memo for {lab_or_group}. It includes: (1) target question, (2) relevant prior work, (3) method tags, and (4) a concrete next step.

Next action: if this is useful, could you forward it to the right internal champion or collaborator? I’m happy to iterate or run a deeper pass.

If you prefer I don’t follow up, just reply “opt out.”

Best,
