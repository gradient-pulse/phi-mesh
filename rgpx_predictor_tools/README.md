# 🔮 RGPx Predictor Tools

**Purpose**  
To collect and develop routines that translate **Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx)** into **predictive capability** across natural, social, and cognitive domains.  
Where classical science models noise, RGPx reads coherence — transforming residuals into foresight.

## 🧠 Core Idea

In RGPx, small-scale “noise” structures (eddies, fluctuations, micro-gradients) act as **carriers of memory** through recursive alignment.  
If they hold memory, they must also hold **predictive power**.

**Predictive premise:**  
> Local gradient patterns at time *t* can forecast macro-level behavior at *t + Δ*  
> more accurately than statistical or Markov baselines.

Each routine here is a step toward turning that principle into executable form.
