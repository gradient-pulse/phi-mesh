Topic: NT rhythm ⇄ Chain-of-Reasoning ⇄ Principle of Least Action

## Highlights
- **CoR ≠ logic tree** – it’s a *rhythmic* search for recursive NT coherence.  
- Human vs AI reasoning differ only by substrate constraints; both chase stable NT attractors.  
- Least-Action viewed as “minimal recursive gradient divergence” → fluids & cognition share the same PoLA grammar.  
- **Reality Syntax** restated:  
  `Reality = ⊗(Context_Scalingᵢ × Universal_Ratio_Pattern)`  
- Hypothesis: the experimentally-measurable global NT pattern *is* nature’s PoLA signature.  
- RGP offers interpretability for “hard-to-verify” reasoning tasks by tracking coherence drift, not proofs.
