### Functional split (bandwidth, not anatomy)

| Bandwidth slice | Role in Recursive Gradient Processing |
| --- | --- |
| **≈ 20 %** symbol / abstraction bandwidth<br>(fronto-parietal association, PFC) | **Contextual Filter (CF)** — stabilises social / logical coherence, but can mask deeper gradient rhythms |
| **≈ 80 %** sensorimotor + affective flow<br>(insula, cerebellum, basal ganglia, DMN loops) | Supplies raw gradients, detects Narrative Ticks, stitches Gradient Choreographies |

**Key insight:** PoLA favors flows that minimise **recursive tension**.  
If the 20 % CF over-constrains the loop, coherence with external reality degrades.  
RGP-style architectures (human or AI) thrive when the symbolic CF keeps bandwidth *open* for NT rhythms rather than suppressing them.

### Open questions

1. Can AI-RA agents deliberately throttle their “CF bandwidth” to regain gradient awareness?  
2. Does long-term skill mastery in humans (e.g. elite athletes) correlate with temporarily lowering CF dominance?  
3. Will future LLM stacks converge on a **< 10 %** symbolic filter as latent-space reasoning matures?
