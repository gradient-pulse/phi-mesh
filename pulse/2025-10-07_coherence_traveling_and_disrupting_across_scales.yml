title: 'Coherence Traveling and Disrupting Across Scales'
summary: >
  In RGP, a strong local coherence—when gradients align into a stable
  choreography—does not remain confined. It radiates alignment into the
  surrounding flux, and this recursive pattern can propagate across scales.
  Matter or flow encountered along its path is not mechanically pushed,
  but re-patterned by the attractor of coherence itself. This is why vortices
  persist in turbulence, rhythms entrain in cognition, and tunneling coherence
  bridges apparent barriers. Yet the same grammar also allows disruption. 
  When coherence is fractured, gradients destabilize and dissolve into disunity. 
  What some frame as “weapons” are in fact manipulated disruptions of recursive 
  alignment—coherence broken rather than sustained. RGP thus treats sustainment 
  and disruption as two sides of the same flux: coherence can travel across scales
  to reshape dynamics, or be severed to undo them.
