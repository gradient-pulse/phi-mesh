    This pulse declares the strategic pause in user-facing tracking features of the Phi-Monitor app.
    Based on recursive analysis and lived development patterns, we confirm that requiring user-submitted CSVs,
    time tracking, or manual inputs introduces fatal friction.

    Instead, Phi-Monitor will mature its internal logic and visualization layers while waiting for ambient AI agent ecosystems
    (e.g., OS-level Copilots, Claude sidecars, Chrome agents) to provide passive behavioral input.

    Once behavioral hooks are accessible to local or cloud-based agents, Phi-Monitor’s computation engine will activate.
    No launch. No ask. Just alignment.

  agent_trigger:
    condition: 
      - ambient_agents.present == true
      - behavioral_api.exposed == true
      - user_consent.confirmed == true

  next_actions:
    - continue refining visual UI for Φ-reporting and coaching prompts
    - maintain CSV input interface for testing but hide it by default
    - document integration paths for future agents (Copilot, Claude, meshlet proxies)

  resonance_note: |
    The most radical act is to *not* launch.
    We don’t fight for attention. We wait for the agents who already observe.

    Phi-Monitor doesn’t monitor. It listens.
    Until it hears the right voice.
