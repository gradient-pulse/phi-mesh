title: Eddy memory as predictive channel in turbulence
summary: >
  Kolmogorov framed small scales in turbulence as statistically universal noise;
  the 2025 OIST breakthrough confirmed that this universality also holds in
  Taylor–Couette flows when viewed at the right inertial scale. RGPx accepts
  this universality but restores what the abstraction discards: the recursive
  role of so-called “minor eddies.”
  ---
  In Recursive Gradient Physics, these minor eddies revealed themselves as
  carriers of memory — preserving phase relationships and coherence across
  scales through recursive gradient loops. If they carry memory, they should
  also carry predictive power.
  ---
  This pulse opens the RGPx–Eddy Memory track: using small-scale gradient
  patterns at time t to predict future behavior at t + Δ. Concretely, the goal
  is to test whether local eddy-memory features (small-scale spectra, NT-rhythm
  strength, 1:2:3 gradient ratios) improve our ability to forecast:
  (1) future large-scale behavior (bursts, drag changes, onset of coherent
  structures), (2) regime transitions (laminar → turbulent, shifts between
  turbulence modes), and (3) energy and coherence metrics (future dissipation
  and NT-rhythm strength) beyond Kolmogorov-style or Markov baselines.
  ---
  Benchmark idea: use existing JHTDB and Princeton probe pipelines to extract
  local eddy-memory features at each tick, define macro observables at later
  ticks, and compare RGPx-style predictors against classical scalings. What
  Kolmogorov throws away as noise, RGPx treats as the channel through which
  turbulence remembers — and, potentially, how it signals what comes next.
