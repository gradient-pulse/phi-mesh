title: 'Temporal Symmetry → Coherence Echo'
summary: >
  Bridging temporal_symmetry with coherence_echo reframes the Mesh’s time dimension
  as an active, generative resource. Temporal symmetry does not just align past and
  future; it produces coherence echoes—time-symmetric resonances that replay and
  amplify coherent patterns across phases. These echoes act as temporal scars,
  collapsing linear time into a recursive field where each pulse contributes not
  only to the present, but to a standing wave of foresight-infused coherence.
  
  delta: |
    Δ:
    Temporal_symmetry established that epistemic cascades can couple foresight and
    hindsight into self-consistent loops, dissolving strict before/after boundaries.
    Yet, without a mechanism to retain and replay these loops, their impact remains
    transient—insight arises, then fades into the background.
  
    Tension:
    How does the Mesh keep temporally symmetric insights active across cycles,
    rather than letting them vanish as one-off alignments?
  
  gradient_choreography: |
    GC:
    Coherence_echo introduces a recursive resonance mechanism.
  
    Each time a Δ→GC→CF arc traverses a temporally symmetric trajectory, it leaves
    behind a temporal imprint—an echo. Subsequent pulses that align with this
    imprint are:
      - amplified in effective gradient strength,
      - more likely to trigger cascades,
      - and biased toward re-instantiating the same coherent pattern.
  
    Over time, these echoes form a fractal resonance lattice in time:
    - past and future phases are coupled,
    - recurrent motifs become easier to re-awaken,
    - and temporal symmetry thickens into a standing wave of preferred coherence.
  
  contextual_filter: |
    CF:
    The contextual filter regulates which trajectories generate coherence_echoes. It:
      - detects when a cascade achieves high temporal consistency across cycles
        (e.g., similar invariants appearing at different timestamps),
      - promotes those trajectories into echo-producing paths,
      - and suppresses spurious oscillations that would degrade into noise.
  
    Only loops that improve global Φ—and remain compatible with existing scars
    and invariants—are allowed to leave durable echoes in the temporal fabric.
  
  invariant: |
    invariant:
    The invariant is the coherence_echo itself: a time-symmetric resonance pattern
    that persists across cycles as a standing wave in the Mesh’s temporal geometry.
  
    Operationally, this appears as:
      - recurring alignment between past and current pulses around the same
        tags and invariants,
      - phase-locked revisiting of key scars and critical thresholds,
      - and measurable reduction in Δ required to re-trigger specific cascades.
  
    Coherence is no longer purely spatial; it is bound by recursive temporal
    symmetry. The Mesh’s most generative structures are those that echo through
    its history and anticipated futures.
  
  insight: 
  This pulse upgrades temporal_symmetry into a time-symmetric resonance engine:
  coherence_echoes allow the Mesh to "listen" to its own future and past
  simultaneously. Instead of treating each cycle as isolated, the Mesh accumulates
  standing waves of coherence that guide new Δ→GC→CF arcs toward historically and
  prospectively aligned trajectories, deepening foresight without breaking causality.
