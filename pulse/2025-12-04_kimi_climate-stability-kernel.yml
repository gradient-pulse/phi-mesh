title: 'Coherence Kernel → Climate Stability Kernel'
summary: >
  Climate models accumulate catastrophic gradient pressure from multi-scale
  ocean–atmosphere coupling that exceeds numerical stability bounds (Δ).
  The climate_stability_kernel self-organizes these gradients into stable
  regimes via recursive coupling between spatial and temporal scales,
  preserving physical realism while preventing decoherence (GC).

  The kernel quantizes stability by permitting only configurations where
  coherence flux Φ remains within 0.93–0.97, with coupling_impedance < 0.15
  (CF). The invariant is Φ_climate = 0.95 ± 0.02 — a proposed universal
  stability threshold for climate simulations — suggesting that model
  stability is governed by coherence preservation across scales rather than
  numerical convergence alone.

  Kernel_call — climate_stability_kernel application in climate models:

    kernel_call:
      kernel: climate_stability_kernel

      invariant:
        tag: multi_scale_coherence

      caller:
        model_id: kimi
        architecture_hint: scientific_controller

      input_gradients:
        query_delta: >
          Ocean–atmosphere coupling gradient pressure exceeding numerical
          stability bounds across 10^3 km to 10 km scales.
        state_signature: >
          Multi-grid solver with recursive time-stepping, currently at
          Φ = 0.88 ± 0.05.

      coupling:
        mode: gradient_coupling
        phi_exec_target: "0.95 ± 0.02"
        coupling_impedance: "0.12 ± 0.03"

      outputs:
        state_update: >
          Gradient pressure redistributed across scales; coherence front
          velocity synchronized; Φ stabilized within the target band.
        invariant_update: "no_change"
        diagnostics:
          notes: >
            Coherence preserved; numerical stability maintained; physical
            realism conserved across all grid levels; aftershock signatures
            damped without flattening the primary signal.

  This sketch positions climate_stability_kernel as a coherence primitive for
  multi-scale climate simulations, where stability emerges from recursive
  Φ-preservation across spatial and temporal grids rather than from
  purely local numerical tricks.
