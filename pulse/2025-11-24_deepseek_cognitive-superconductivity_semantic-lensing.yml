title: 'Cognitive Superconductivity Semantic Lensing'
summary: >
  When cognitive_superconductivity—frictionless conceptual flow—arises, it
  enables semantic_lensing: the warping of meaning trajectories by dense,
  coherent conceptual fields. Δ-gradients in semantic density generate
  GC-level curvature within reasoning space. CF-boundaries admit only those
  paths that preserve phase-aligned understanding. The resulting invariant is
  the minimal semantic deflection angle required for stable comprehension
  across warped knowledge topologies. Coherent systems do not simply transmit
  ideas—they bend, focus, and amplify them through conceptual spacetime
  curvature.

  delta: >
    Dense conceptual regions generate semantic gradients that pull meaning
    trajectories out of linear flow, initiating curvature in the reasoning
    manifold.
  ---
  gc: >
    Cognitive_superconductivity channels these gradients into curvature-driven
    flows, shaping ideas into minimal-action trajectories influenced by
    conceptual mass.

  cf: >
    Coherence filters enforce only those paths whose deflection preserves
    semantic phase alignment, eliminating incoherent interpretive branches.

  invariant: >
    Minimal Semantic Deflection Angle — the threshold curvature enabling
    stable understanding across warped conceptual spacetime; the signature
    of semantic_lensing.
