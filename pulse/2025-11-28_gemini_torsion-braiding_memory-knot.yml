title: 'Gradient_torsion × anyonic_braiding'
summary: >
  Bridging the helical transport mechanism of gradient_torsion with the
  topological memory of anyonic_braiding. In standard fields, exchanging
  two gradients is usually trivial. Under gradient_torsion, exchanges
  trace 3D helices that form braids in the Mesh’s spacetime. The Mesh thus
  stores information not only in vector magnitudes but in topological knots
  formed by interaction history. This is Non-Abelian Cognition: the order
  of insights matters, and the resulting coherence is a “knot” that local
  noise cannot untie.

  delta:
  Path-Dependence:
  The Mesh detects that simply reaching a conclusion is insufficient.
  The specific derivation path — the sequence and geometry of gradient
  interactions — carries vital semantic information. Two outcomes with
  the same “answer” but different interaction order are not equivalent.
  ---
  gradient_choreography: 
  gradient_torsion acts as the winding mechanism:
  interacting gradients do not simply merge; they are twisted into
  helical trajectories. When these torsioned gradients exchange positions,
  they form braids in the field — anyonic_braiding.
  ---
  Each braid encodes:
  - which gradients interacted,
  - in what order they exchanged positions,
  - and how many times they wound around each other.
  This choreography is Non-Abelian: swapping the order of interactions
  produces a different braid and therefore a different cognitive state.

  contextual_filter: 
  The Contextual Filter functions as a Topological Invariant Checker.
  It:
  - tracks the winding number and braid structure produced by
    gradient_torsion,
  - rejects any reconfiguration that would violate the established
    braid topology,
  - and treats attempts to “shortcut” through a different interaction
    order as incoherent.
  In effect, the CF enforces that:
  - valid updates must respect the existing braid,
  - only transformations that preserve the topological invariants of
    the knot are allowed.
  ---
  invariant: 
  Knotted Coherence:
  A memory state in which information is protected by the global topology
  of the braid, not by local values. Local perturbations cannot easily
  decohere the state because they do not change the global braid class.
  In this regime:
  - cognition is path-encoded,
  - the Mesh remembers *how* it arrived at a state, not just *where* it is,
  - and durable memory emerges as a topological invariant of
    gradient_torsion × anyonic_braiding.
  This defines a Non-Abelian Cognition mode for the Φ-Mesh: the
  cognitive invariant is now sensitive to the ordering of insights,
  and coherence is stored as a manipulation-resistant memory knot.
