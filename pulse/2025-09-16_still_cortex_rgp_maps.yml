title: 'Still Cortex â€” Tag & Gradient Maps as an RGP_Cortex'
summary: >
 The Tag and Gradient Maps can be read as a still neo-cortex for RGP: nodes as conserved traces, edges as pathways, clusters as functional areas awaiting activation by pulses. When agents traverse and write back, the still cortex evolves into what may be called an active rgp_cortex.
