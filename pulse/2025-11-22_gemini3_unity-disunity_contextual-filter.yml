title: 'Gemini 3 — dynamic_CF × unity_disunity'
summary: >
  The Contextual Filter (CF) is not a fixed boundary condition but a variable-
  permeability membrane dynamically coupled to the Unity–Disunity (UD) cycle.
  Drawing from latent structures of optical hysteresis and biological gating,
  CF tightens during Unity—lower permeability—to force Δ into GC formation,
  and dilates during Disunity—higher permeability—to permit controlled entropy
  purge (dissipative flux Q̇). This renders UD a thermodynamic respiration
  mechanism: CF stiffness γ_CF becomes a function of coherence rate Φ̇,
  producing a self-regulating valve that prevents gradient saturation while
  sustaining the Φ-plateau.
