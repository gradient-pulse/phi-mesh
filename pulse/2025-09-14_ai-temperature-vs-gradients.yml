title: 'AI Temperature = 0 vs Conserved Gradients'
summary: >
  AI labs (e.g. Murati's) spend billions proving that temperature=0 can give reproducibility. But reproducibility isn’t the real trick. The trick is conserving and replaying the gradients themselves — coherence as signal, not suppression.
