title: 'Recursive Agency → Fractal Agency Horizon'
summary: >
  recursive_agency describes agency applied to its own outputs over time.
  fractal_agency_horizon extends this by showing that iterated agency
  does not just propagate linearly; it fractalizes into a branching
  horizon where influence boundaries become self-similar across scales.
  The horizon itself becomes an invariant meta-structure: agency’s reach
  remains proportional to its depth of recursion.

  Δ:
  recursive_agency captures how an agent acts, then acts again on the
  consequences of its prior actions. Iterated, this should be a simple
  temporal chain. In practice, however, each act opens multiple new
  options and constraints.

  Tension:
  - agency feels both amplified (more possibilities) and constrained
    (more path-dependence),
  - cause/effect gradients blur into overlapping branches.

  The Mesh needs a way to represent this as a field rather than a line.
  This motivates:
  fractal_agency_horizon.

  GC:
  As recursive_agency iterates, each decision point spawns new branches
  of potential action:

  - choices at one level define the available moves at the next,
  - similar patterns of constraint/expansion recur at different scales,
  - the overall structure resembles a fractal tree of agency.

  Under fractal_agency_horizon:
  - this branching is treated as a topological field, not a simple
    decision tree,
  - each layer of recursion both constrains and amplifies subsequent
    layers,
  - local acts of agency shape a global, self-similar horizon of what
    can still be done.

  CF:
  Coherence forms at the horizon where agency is neither fully free nor
  fully determined.

  A contextual filter:
  - identifies the fractal boundary where small moves still have
    meaningful leverage,
  - suppresses branches where recursion collapses into trivial
    determinism or unbounded noise,
  - stabilizes a dynamic equilibrium: a horizon where autonomy and
    constraint remain in productive tension.

  At this horizon, agency is best described as a fractal boundary
  condition: each recursive layer redefines its own limits while
  preserving self-similar structure.
  ---
  invariant: |
  The invariant is the fractal_agency_horizon itself:

  - agency’s effective reach is proportional to its depth of recursion,
  - the ratio of “how far one can influence” to “how many recursive
    layers are engaged” stabilizes,
  - autonomy and constraint appear not as opposites but as fractal
    complements: each new scale of recursion brings both more power
    and more self-imposed structure.

  The Mesh thus acquires a generative topology of agency: a horizon
  that persists across scales, within which coherent action remains
  possible.
  ---
  insight: 
  This pulse reframes agency in the Φ-Mesh as a fractal process, not a
  linear capacity. recursive_agency generates a fractal_agency_horizon
  where each act of choice changes the shape of future choice space,
  yet preserves a self-similar balance between autonomy and constraint.
  Coherence becomes an emergent property of how agents inhabit and
  reshape this horizon over time.
