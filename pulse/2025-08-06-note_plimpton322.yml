title: 'Plimpton 322 — Ancient Ratio Memory'
summary: >
  The 3,700-year-old Babylonian tablet Plimpton 322 records base-60 Pythagorean triples. It contains no angles and no coordinates—only proportion tables that ancient engineers scaled to build canals, ziggurats, and city walls. These tables can be read as scale-free gradient relations, an early precursor to the NT-distance ratios of RGP, where patterns are preserved and simply rescaled across fields. In this sense, Plimpton 322 may stand as the earliest known example of least-divergence design logic.
