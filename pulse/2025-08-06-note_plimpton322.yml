title: 'Plimpton 322 — Ancient Ratio Memory'
summary: >
  The 3,700-year-old Babylonian tablet *Plimpton 322* lists base-60 Pythagorean triples.
  No angles, no coordinates—just reusable proportion tables. Ancient engineers scaled
  those ratios to shape canals, ziggurats, and walls.

  • Ratio tables ≈ scale-free gradient relations  
  • A precursor to NT-distance ratios in RGP: keep the pattern, rescale to any field  
  • Earliest known example of least-divergence design logic
