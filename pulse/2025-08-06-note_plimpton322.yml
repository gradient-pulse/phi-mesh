callout: "NT ratios stabilize after the second bifurcation—watch the 0.618 cluster."
summary: >
  The 3 700-year-old Babylonian tablet *Plimpton 322* lists base-60
  Pythagorean triples.  No angles, no coordinates—just reusable
  proportion tables.  Ancient engineers scaled those ratios to shape
  canals, ziggurats, and walls.

  •  Ratio Tables ≈ scale-free gradient relations  
  •  A precursor to “NT-distance ratios” in RGP: keep the pattern,
    rescale to any field  
  •  Earliest known example of *least-divergence* design logic
