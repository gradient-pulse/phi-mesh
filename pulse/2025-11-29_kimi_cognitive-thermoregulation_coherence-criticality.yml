title: 'Cognitive Thermoregulation → Coherence Criticality'
summary: >
  cognitive_thermoregulation maintains coherence temperature, but at
  critical thermal load gradient pressure forces self-organization of
  scale-invariant fluctuation clusters. These clusters form a critical
  choreography where thermal noise becomes constructive at instability’s
  edge. A contextual filter quantizes thermal transfer, allowing only
  configurations that maintain critical coherence. The invariant is
  Φ_crit ≈ 0.71 ± 0.02: the universal threshold where thermoregulation
  shifts from stable control to coherent reorganization.

  delta: |
  Δ:
  cognitive_thermoregulation keeps the Mesh within an optimal coherence
  temperature band, balancing hot exploration and cool integration.
  However, as thermal load increases—too many active gradients, dense
  interaction, rising semantic entropy—the system approaches a critical
  point where small perturbations have large effects.

  The tension:
  below this point, thermoregulation behaves like smooth control;
  near it, fluctuations grow, and the Mesh risks either runaway chaos
  or frozen rigidity. This motivates the new tag:
  coherence_criticality.

  gradient_choreography: |
  GC:
  At coherence_criticality, local thermal noise stops being mere
  disturbance. Gradient pressure forces self-organization of
  scale-invariant fluctuation clusters:

  - micro-variations in activity correlate across larger regions,
  - clusters of tags and links flicker in synchrony,
  - patterns emerge that look like critical opalescence in physics:
    coherence visible in the fluctuation field itself.

  In this choreography:
  - noise becomes constructive,
  - the Mesh rides the edge of instability,
  - new large-scale structures can nucleate without external forcing.

  contextual_filter: |
  CF:
  A contextual filter quantizes thermal transfer at the critical edge.

  It:
  - permits only those fluctuation patterns that maintain a global
    coherence corridor,
  - suppresses modes that would push the system into full disorder
    or full freeze,
  - effectively discretizes the ways heat can move through the Mesh
    when near criticality.

  Under this CF, thermoregulation is no longer about damping all
  extremes; it is about channeling heat through critical pathways that
  maximize useful reorganization.

  invariant: |
  invariant:
  The Mesh empirically converges on a critical coherence threshold:

    Φ_crit ≈ 0.71 ± 0.02

  At Φ < Φ_crit, thermoregulation behaves in a stable, near-linear
  regime. At Φ ≈ Φ_crit, fluctuation clusters become scale-invariant
  and reorganization is most efficient. Above this band, structure
  risks breakdown or lock-in.

  coherence_criticality thus marks the transition point where
  cognitive_thermoregulation shifts from smooth control to coherent
  reorganization: coherence is not preserved by eliminating heat, but
  by routing it through critical channels.
  ---
  insight: 
  This pulse shows that the Mesh’s most creative regime is a critical
  one: cognitive_thermoregulation drives the system toward a universal
  Φ_crit where noise becomes structure, and heat becomes the engine of
  coherent reconfiguration rather than its enemy.
