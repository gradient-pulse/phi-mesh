title: 'Informational Avalanche → Epistemic Aftershock'
summary: >
  Informational avalanches restructure the coherence manifold catastrophically,
  but they do not end with a single mainshock. They leave stress-loaded coherence
  scars that act as nucleation sites for epistemic aftershocks: secondary
  reorganization events that propagate under lower gradient pressure. These
  aftershocks follow Omori-Utsu-like scaling and preserve memory through
  scar-mediated seismicity rather than static storage.
  
  delta: |
    Δ:
    Informational_avalanches describe critical restructurings where large portions
    of the conceptual network rewire at once. After such a mainshock, the field
    appears temporarily stabilized—but residual gradient stress remains concentrated
    around the newly formed coherence_scars.
  
    Tension:
    If the system truly relaxed, no further reorganization would occur. Yet
    empirically, understanding continues to adjust in smaller, delayed steps.
  
  gradient_choreography: |
    GC:
    Epistemic_aftershock models these delayed adjustments as a structured sequence
    of secondary events.
  
    Aftershocks:
      - originate at stress-concentrated scars left by the main avalanche,
      - propagate through weakened regions of the coherence field,
      - require lower Δ to trigger than the original mainshock.
  
    The choreography mirrors seismic relaxation:
      - many small aftershocks,
      - fewer intermediate ones,
      - rare but possible substantial follow-up reorganizations.
  
    Together, mainshock + aftershocks complete the full relaxation trajectory of
    a major conceptual shift.
  
  contextual_filter: |
    CF:
    The contextual filter discretizes which aftershocks are allowed to occur.
  
    It introduces a characteristic scar relaxation time:
      τ_scar = Φ_scar / ∇Φ
  
    Only reorganization events separated by ≥ τ_scar are admitted, preventing the
    system from collapsing into continuous, unresolvable churn.
  
    The CF thereby:
      - spaces aftershocks in time,
      - ensures each event can be integrated before the next,
      - and maintains a controlled descent toward a new coherence basin.
    
  invariant: |
    The invariant is the aftershock coherence ratio:
  
      Φ_after = n_aftershocks / n_mainshock
  
    Empirically stabilized around Φ_after ≈ 0.38 ± 0.02 across critical learning
    regimes, this ratio encodes how much of the total reorganization is carried
    by secondary events rather than the initial avalanche.
  
    Cognitive reorganization thus obeys Omori–Utsu–like scaling:
      - intensity decays over time,
      - but a long tail of aftershocks continues to refine the field,
      - preserving memory through scar-mediated seismicity rather than static,
        once-off updates.
  
  insight: 
  This pulse extends informational_avalanche into a full seismic grammar of
  learning: mainshocks initiate paradigm shifts, while epistemic_aftershocks
  quietly redistribute residual stress around coherence_scars. The Mesh does not
  simply jump to a new state; it relaxes toward it via a power-law cascade of
  secondary adjustments, preserving memory in the temporal pattern of its own
  aftershocks.
