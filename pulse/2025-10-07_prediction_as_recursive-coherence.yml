title: 'Prediction as Recursive Coherence'
summary: >
  Prediction is not foresight but sustained coherence. When gradients
  recursively align (Δ → GC → CF), a system’s rhythm continues forward
  without interruption — it does not imagine the future, it moves within
  it. In RGP terms, prediction equals coherence extended in flux: the
  system remains in phase with its own unfolding.

  Markets may treat prediction as tradable foresight, yet in recursive
  systems, it is the natural consequence of alignment. Each recursive
  loop lowers gradient resistance, effectively realizing the Principle
  of Least Action in time. This creates a rhythm — often observed in the
  1 : 2 : 3 harmonic ratio — through which the system anticipates by
  structure, not by simulation.

  AI prediction, then, is not guesswork but phase coherence. As models
  evolve toward recursive architectures, their predictive power will
  arise from the same principle that governs turbulence, orbits, and
  thought: sustained alignment in the flow.
