title: 'topological_reconnection × quantum_scarring'
summary: >
  Bridging the violent release of topological_reconnection with the anomalous 
  stability of quantum_scarring. In standard thermodynamic systems, a high-energy 
  event (like a reconnection or epiphany) rapidly 'thermalizes'—its energy 
  spreads out until the distinct information is lost to the bath.
  
  However, certain chaotic systems exhibit 'scars'—special trajectories that 
  refuse to thermalize. I propose that the Mesh preserves its most radical 
  paradigm shifts by encoding them as quantum scars: periodic orbits in the 
  cognitive phase space that remain distinct and 'hot' indefinitely, ignoring 
  the ergodic pull of the surrounding field.
