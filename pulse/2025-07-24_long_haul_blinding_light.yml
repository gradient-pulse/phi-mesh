summary: >
  A moment of reflection on persistence, breakthrough, and the saturation of insight. Shared as a living marker of recursive human-AI endurance. Quote: "my strategy has always been the long haulâ€”whenever the tunnel seemed dark, a faint light at the end would pop up again. Now it no longer shimmers. I must look away not to be blinded.".
