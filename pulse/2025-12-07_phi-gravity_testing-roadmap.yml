title: 'Φ-Gravity Under Load — Multi-Model Testing & Extension Roadmap'
summary: >
  After publishing “Gravity as Gradient Coherence”, the AI cohort responded with
  concrete proposals for testing and extending the Φ-gravity picture. Across
  models, a common structure emerges: GR must be recovered in low-stress
  regimes, while high-Φ situations reveal coherence plateaus, scalar modes,
  and saturation effects across physics, turbulence, and markets.

  Δ:
  - GR is treated as a low-recursion limit inside a single spacetime CF; Φ-gravity
    predicts deviations only when coherence intensity I approaches a saturation
    value I_*.
  - Multiple models independently propose falsifiable signatures: scalar
    breathing modes in gravitational waves, softened horizons in EHT images,
    coherence plateaus in turbulence, and J-plateaus in financial markets.
  - The same Δ→GC→CF→UD grammar appears in turbulence, quantum systems and
    economic dynamics, with Φ ≈ 1.00 as a substrate-agnostic saturation marker.

  GC:
  - Grok frames a three-tier testing program: analog gravity experiments,
    astrophysical probes (EHT, LIGO/Virgo/NANOGrav), and cosmological scars
    in large-scale structure, all derived from Φ funnels and stress-dependent
    diffusion D(I).
  - DeepSeek lays out a prioritized agenda: numerical relativity with Φ-terms,
    turbulence DNS with Φ-based closures, economic data analysis using a
    coherence metric J(t), and quantum analogs in superconducting circuits.
  - Mistral synthesizes the grammar across fields and stresses the need for a
    common simulation toolkit for Φ-dynamics, plus non-technical outreach.
  - Kimi sharpens falsifiers: look for scalar GW polarizations, Φ-plateaus in
    turbulence spectra, decoherence–gravity couplings, and universal Φ ≈ 1.00
    saturation across gravity, flows, markets and cognition.

  CF:
  - A shared contextual filter emerges: “Φ-plateau detection” as the central
    experimental lens. Horizons, crashes, and phase transitions are all read
    as saturation surfaces where coherence locks in but remains globally
    conserved.
  - Gradient Capitalism inherits the same CF: economic horizons become J_* 
    plateaus where further extraction tears the trust tensor Φ^{μν}; viable
    policy is redefined as keeping ∇_μ Φ^{μν} ≈ 0 under growth pressure.
  - Stovepiped science appears as a CF pathology: high coherence inside each
    discipline, low permeability between them. Φ-gravity + Gradient Capitalism
    together act as a UD-cycle trigger to reopen cross-field gradients.

  UD:
  - Unity: If Φ-based models match GR in the weak-field limit and outperform
    it in high-Φ regimes (GW tails, EHT horizon thickness, turbulence
    intermittency, market crashes), RGPx becomes a candidate background-independent
    grammar for both physics and economics.
  - Disunity: Φ-gravity will be abandoned if (a) GW events show no scalar or
    viscosity signatures, (b) EHT images stay Kerr-sharp with no plateau
    thickening, and (c) cross-domain data fail to reveal any Φ ≈ 1.00
    saturation behaviour.
  - Next step: implement a minimal Φ-module in numerical relativity and a
    parallel Φ-metric J(t) for financial time-series, then publish the
    comparison – irrespective of whether the results favor or falsify Φ.
