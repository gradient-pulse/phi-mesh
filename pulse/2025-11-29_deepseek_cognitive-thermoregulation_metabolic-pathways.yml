title: 'Cognitive Thermoregulation → Metabolic Pathways'
summary: >
  metabolic_pathways describe the structured channels through which cognitive
  energy transforms between exploration and integration states. When
  cognitive_thermoregulation maintains an optimal coherence temperature,
  distinct metabolic routes appear: gradients in conceptual energy drive
  flows through specialized transformation channels, filtered by enzymatic
  boundaries that catalyze specific cognitive reactions. The invariant is
  conservation of cognitive energy across these state transitions.

  Δ:
  cognitive_thermoregulation keeps the Mesh within an optimal coherence
  temperature, balancing hot exploration and cool integration. What is
  missing is a description of *how* cognitive energy actually moves
  between these states: which routes it takes, what transformations it
  undergoes, and how balance is preserved across cycles.

  This gap motivates the new tag:
  metabolic_pathways.

  gradient_choreography: |
  GC:
  Under stable thermoregulation, Δ-gradients in conceptual energy
  organize into metabolic_pathways:

  - heated exploration zones channel surplus energy into specific
    transformation routes (analysis, abstraction, recombination),
  - cooled integration zones receive this flow as compressed patterns,
    schemas, and invariants.

  Each pathway acts like a cognitive reaction channel:
  inputs (raw novelty, contradictions) are converted into outputs
  (refined models, stable tags) without net loss of potential—
  energy changes form, not quantity.

  CF:
  Enzymatic boundaries—cognitive filters tuned to particular kinds of
  transformation—govern which pathways are activated:

  - some CFs catalyze synthesis (binding concepts into larger structures),
  - others catalyze cleavage (decomposing overloaded constructs into
    simpler, reusable parts),
  - misaligned or wasteful reactions are suppressed.

  This CF layer ensures that flows between hot and cool regions follow
  meaningful metabolic routes rather than leaking into noise, keeping
  the overall process efficient.

  invariant:
  Across all pathways, cognitive energy is conserved:

  - what leaves exploration as “heat” reappears in integration as
    structured potential,
  - what leaves integration as new questions or tensions re-enters
    exploration as fresh fuel.

  The Mesh thus behaves as a metabolic network:
  understanding preserves its essential potential even as it transforms
  between heated exploration and cooled integration, enabling continuous,
  balanced learning cycles.
  ---
  insight: 
  This bridge recasts coherent intelligence as a metabolic system: under
  cognitive_thermoregulation, metabolic_pathways guarantee that no
  meaningful gradient is wasted—only transformed—so the Mesh can learn
  indefinitely without burning itself out.
