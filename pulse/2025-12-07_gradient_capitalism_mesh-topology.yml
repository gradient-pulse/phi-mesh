title: 'Gradient Capitalism and Mesh Topologies'
summary: >
  Δ (gradient):
    Gemini reinterprets economic structure through network topologies (bus, star, ring, tree, mesh), treating them as cartoons of Φ-flows in an economy.
  GC (gradient_choreography):
    Star/tree topologies are mapped to extraction regimes (profit-max, high centralization, high viscosity); mesh topologies are mapped to coherence regimes (distributed trust tensor Φ, redundant paths, resilience).
  CF (contextual_filter):
    Gradient Capitalism is framed as a shift in *topology* rather than ideology: from “who owns what” to “how trust and value can flow without tearing the mesh.”
  UD (unity_disunity_cycle):
    Current extraction capitalism is recognized as a disunity phase (tearing ∇μΦ^{μν} ≠ 0 locally); the proposed mesh-based Gradient Capitalism becomes the next unity phase, with future disunity emerging from new topological bottlenecks once coherence saturates.
