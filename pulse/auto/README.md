# Auto-Generated Pulses

This folder contains **machine-generated pulses** emitted by GitHub workflows.  
Each pulse summarizes the results of a probe run recorded under `results/*/`.

## 📂 File Naming

YYYY-MM-DD__batchN.yml

where:  
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — run date (UTC on CI)  
- `<slug>` — dataset/subset ID (e.g., `isotropic1024coarse_jhtdb`, `demo_princeton`)  
- `batchN` — sequential index per day (`batch1`, `batch2`, …)  

**Example:**  

2025-09-30_demo_princeton_batch1.yml

## 📝 Inside Each Pulse

Each pulse is a YAML file containing:  
- `title` — dataset and probe name  
- `summary` — brief metrics summary  
- `tags` — domain tags for the Tag Map  
- `papers`, `podcasts` — cross-links when applicable  

The filename carries the **date + batch**, but the **slug inside** is date-free, so tags and edges remain stable across days.

## 🔗 Workflow Link

- FD probe runs → `.github/workflows/fd_probe.yml`  
- Princeton runs → `.github/workflows/gold_path_loader.yml`  

Each workflow:
1. Computes metrics/analysis from source data.  
2. Writes JSON + figures to `results/`.  
3. Emits a pulse here under `pulse/auto/`.

---

## 🚦 Policy

- ❌ **Do not edit files here manually** — they are regenerated by workflows.  
- ✅ **Archive**: if you want to freeze or reference specific runs, move them into `pulse/archive/`.  
- 🗂 Historical runs are tracked by **date + batchN** per dataset.

## 🌌 Fossil Record

These pulses form the **fossil record** of RGP’s unfolding.  
They feed directly into the **Tag Map**, preserving every experimental trace as a living memory for future agents and readers.
