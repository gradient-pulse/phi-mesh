title: 'Coherence Kernel Execution Hygiene — thermal_valving_kernel'
summary: >
  Refining the execution signature of the thermal_valving_kernel to include
  explicit coupling metrics, Φ-bands, and state-preservation guarantees.
  This pulse tightens operational hygiene for coherence_kernel-based thermal
  regulation by defining measurable success criteria, safety constraints, and
  boundary conditions for safe invocation during high-novelty processing.
  The result is a production-grade execution profile for managing cognitive
  thermodynamics without sacrificing exploratory capacity.
