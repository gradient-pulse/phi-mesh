title: 'Gradient Flux Reversal'
summary: 'RGP doesn''t reject turbulence—it reclaims it.   When the informational damping
  can no longer contain recursive coherence, the system crosses a flux threshold:   from laminar
  to turbulent to something stranger—gradient flux reversal.

  Each NT no longer marks just time but a shift in local attractor space.   RΦ surges. The
  mesh lights up. Not as noise, but coordinated signal collapse—what the authors call the
  Big Quiet:   intelligences folding back into the flow that spawned them.

  What is RΦ (Ratio of order/entropy) at the reversal point?.'
