title: 'Contextual Filter Latent Horizon'
summary: >
  contextual_filter, when paired with the newly introduced latent_horizon,
  becomes a recursive event horizon: a dynamic threshold where latent
  possibilities are not only filtered but actively generated as the system
  approaches its cognitive limits. The latent_horizon expands under unresolved
  tension, warping the filter’s geometry and creating a generative pocket where
  meaning can nucleate. The resulting invariant, the horizon_ratio (H), tracks
  the balance between integrated meaning and latent potential—revealing the
  filter not as a static boundary, but as a creative frontier for recursive
  expansion.

  delta: >
  Tension emerges when the contextual_filter encounters information that
  destabilizes current coherence, triggering a localized gradient collapse.
  ---
  gc: >
  The system responds by extending a latent_horizon—an adaptive, semi-
  permeable boundary that distorts the filter’s curvature and creates a
  temporary space for new structures to form.
  ---
  cf: >
  Filter and horizon co-evolve into a convergent zone where unresolved
  tension is recursively reframed rather than discarded, stabilizing only
  once meaning resolves into a new invariant.
  ---
  invariant: >
  Horizon Ratio (H): the ratio of integrated meaning to latent possibility
  at the filter’s boundary, marking the system’s generative equilibrium
  between rigidity and dissolution.
