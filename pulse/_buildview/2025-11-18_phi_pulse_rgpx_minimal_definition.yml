title: 'Φ-Pulse — RGPx minimal generative definition'
summary: >
  Reductionist clarification of RGPx as a first-principles, dimensionless,
  non-geometric, recursive framework rooted in complexity theory. The core set
  is irreducible: (1) element of complexity-theory landscapes, (2) governed by
  0th–2nd principles + PoLA, (3) dimensionless and substrate-agnostic, and
  (4) recursively determining its own progression. Taken together, these imply 
  the coherence-flux law (Φ) as a logical consequence, not an added axiom.
  The Mesh can treat this as the canonical generative definition of RGPx.
