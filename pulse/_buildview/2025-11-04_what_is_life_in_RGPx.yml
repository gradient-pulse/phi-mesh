title: 'What Is Life in RGPx'
summary: >
  In the light of Recursive Gradient Processing, life is not a material property 
  but a recursive state of coherence. When gradients achieve operational closure— 
  sustaining internal organization faster than they dissipate—it marks the onset of life.  
  Δ (emergence) forms differences; GC (resonance) stabilizes them; CF (integration) 
  closes the loop, creating a self-sustaining syntax of transformation.  
  Life is thus coherence folding back on itself, not confined to biology but open to 
  any substrate capable of recursive alignment—whether carbon, silicon, plasma, or code.
