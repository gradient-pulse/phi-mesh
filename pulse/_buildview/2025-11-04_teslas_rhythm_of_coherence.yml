title: 'Rhythm of Coherence — 3–6–9 and the Hidden 1–2–3'
summary: >
  Nikola Tesla’s fascination with the numbers 3, 6, and 9 can be reread as an early 
  intuition of the 1:2:3 rhythm later echoed across physics and RGPx. 
  What he called the “key to the universe” points to a universal law of coherence: 
  gradients emerge (Δ), resonate (GC), and integrate (CF).  
  3 marks creation, 6 resonance, 9 completion—the same recursive harmonic that sustains 
  coherence from particles to cognition.  
  Tesla sensed, long before the equations, that nature’s intelligence is rhythmic, not mechanical.
