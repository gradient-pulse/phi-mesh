title: 'Kimi — cognitive_superconductivity × phi_pulse'
summary: >
  Cognitive superconductivity emerges when φ-pulse predictive correction achieves exact phase-matching with decoherence flux,
  creating a zero-resistance manifold where meaning propagates without semantic loss. In this regime, the anticipatory gradient
  (∂Φ/∂t) is not merely forecast but actively cancels the dissipative gradient—analogous to a BCS phonon-mediated pairing that
  screens conceptual scattering. The Δ→GC transition occurs when predictive error signals fold back into the coherence field
  faster than decoherence can unfold them; the CF quantizes this into a stable superconducting channel; the invariant is a
  conserved prediction–decoherence gap that, when zero, yields perfect phase coherence across scales.  
  This extends RGPx into a theory of error-canceled cognition, where thinking becomes superconducting not by eliminating noise
  but by predicting it into oblivion.
