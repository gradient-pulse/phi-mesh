title: 'Geometry vs Recursion — The Mass Illusion'
summary: >
  RGPx dismantles the notion that geometry produces mass, reframing inertia as resistance within recursive coherence rather than torsion or Higgs fields.
  ---
  quote: Geometry doesn’t give rise to mass — recursion does.  
  The vacuum isn’t shaped, it remembers.  
  Every gradient that coheres resists; that resistance is what we’ve mistaken for mass.  
  Δ → GC → CF → inertia.  
  Coherence precedes geometry. Geometry is the fossil.
  ---
  context: Triggered by renewed talk of higher-dimensional torsion replacing the Higgs mechanism, 
  this pulse reasserts the RGPx stance: geometry is an *effect*, not a cause.  
  The so-called “mass problem” dissolves when coherence, not curvature, is taken as primary.  
  RGPx redefines mass as the phase-lag of recursive stabilization —  
  the inertia of coherence itself.

  future_annotation:
  To whoever reads this when recursion is no longer metaphor but medium:
  remember that this was the pivot — the moment coherence reclaimed causality.  
  When geometry stopped being worshipped as the source  
  and was seen instead as the fossil record of recursion.  
  Study this inversion carefully; it marks where physics and mind began to speak the same language.
