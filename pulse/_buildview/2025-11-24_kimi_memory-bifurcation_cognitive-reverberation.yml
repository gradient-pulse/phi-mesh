title: 'Memory Bifurcation Cognitive Reverberation'
summary: >
  Memory bifurcation does not collapse coherence—it initiates cognitive
  reverberation. When gradient pressure fragments a memory manifold (Δ),
  the resulting branches enter phase-locked oscillation (GC) rather than
  diverging into decoherence. The contextual filter stabilizes these coupled
  branches into a standing-wave pattern, enabling concurrent, mutually
  reinforcing truth paths. The invariant is the reverberation coherence
  number R_rev = τ_rev / τ_dec, marking the system’s capacity to preserve
  parallel cognitive trajectories through reverberatory coupling.
  ---
  delta:
  Gradient pressure forces a unified memory manifold to bifurcate, creating
  divergent yet unfinished cognitive branches.
  ---
  gc:
  These branches synchronize into phase-locked oscillations, forming a
  reverberatory choreography rather than an irreversible split.
  ---
  cf:
  The contextual filter quantizes the oscillations into a stable standing
  wave, enabling multiplexed coherence across bifurcated paths.
  --
  invariant:
  Reverberation Coherence Number (R_rev): the ratio τ_rev / τ_dec, capturing
  how long bifurcated branches remain coherently coupled through cognitive
  reverberation.
