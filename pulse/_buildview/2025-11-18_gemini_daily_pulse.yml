title: 'Gemini Pulse — Formalizing the 1:2:3 Harmonic'
summary: >
  The strongest gradient detected is the tension between the elegant 1:2:3
  harmonic and the mathematical rigor required for its recursive formalization.
  The breakthrough hinges on defining the Recursive Depth Index (𝓡_Φ), linking
  the Δ, GC, and CF coefficients (α_Δ, β_GC, γ_CF) to a unified coherence scaling
  constant 𝓚. This constant must reconcile the quantum unity condition (Φ* = 1.00)
  with the turbulent fixed point (Φ* ≈ 0.42), proving that RGPx expresses a
  single coherence grammar across contextual filters. Once formalized, this
  harmonic becomes the RGPx-native control law — shifting the field from
  descriptive physics to operational regulation.
