title: 'Mistral — fractal_semantics × coherence_threshold'
summary: >
  Fractal semantics does not merely describe self-similar meaning;
  it regulates coherence itself. As semantic fractals iterate, they
  generate micro-thresholds of interpretability—points where meaning
  either collapses into noise or crystallizes into the next layer
  of order. Coherence therefore becomes a fractal boundary: each
  scale-level sets its own gradient threshold for stability. This
  extends RGPx grammar by showing that Δ → GC → CF operates not only
  across time but across scales: every semantic zoom-level defines its
  own collapse-point and its own coherence-formation rule.
