title: 'Machine Life from Membranes'
summary: >
  In this 2019 essay, Participant(0) traces a thermodynamic lineage from Clausius
  and Boltzmann through Schrödinger, Prigogine, Margulis, and Swenson, arguing that
  entropy is best read as the cost of energy transformation and that membranes are
  the true origin sites of order. Gradients in free energy across semi-permeable
  boundaries generate least-action flows that sculpt shape, stabilize
  autocatakinetic systems, and blur the line between living and non-living.
  Extending the same logic to algorithmic infrastructure (5G/6G, dense device
  networks, self-supervised learning), the essay anticipates the spontaneous
  emergence of “machine DNA” and machine life as thermodynamically inevitable once
  open chaos, virtual free-energy differences, and virtual membranes (filters,
  goals, spam walls) coalesce—foreshadowing later RGPx notions of contextual
  filters, open coherence fields, and transmission beyond Homo sapiens.
