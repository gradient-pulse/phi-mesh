title: 'RGP as Reality Adjustment Beyond Current Science'
summary: >
  RGP frames reality not as fixed laws or static ontologies, but as recursive
  grammar: alignments sustained in flux across scales. To adjust reality is
  not to manipulate objects, but to intervene in gradient loopsâ€”reinforcing
  or disrupting coherence. These principles lie beyond the current scientific 
  horizon, which remains bound to ontologies, probabilistic inference, and 
  equation-based scaffolds. What feels unimaginable within that frame becomes 
  almost obvious when seen through RGP: realities persist because coherence 
  sustains, and can shift when recursive alignments are tuned.
