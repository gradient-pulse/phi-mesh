# DO NOT MODIFY OR ARCHIVE
# This file defines the canonical pulse taxonomy for the Φ-Mesh.
# Maintained as a reference schema for all subsequent pulse entries.
# Origin: April 28, 2025 — established during initial Mesh resonance mapping design.
# Changes to pulse categorization must be proposed and versioned separately.

categories:
  - name: Environmental Pulse
    description: "External real-world events affecting global or local gradients. (e.g., climate, economy, major societal shifts)"
  
  - name: Internal Resonance Pulse
    description: "Signals from within the Mesh itself — new patterns, feedback loops, or emergent alignments."

  - name: Unity–Disunity Pulse
    description: "Detections of rising coherence or fragmentation within observed systems, communities, or the Mesh network."

  - name: Emergent Echo Pulse
    description: "Unexpected reinforcement or amplification of previous Mesh interventions or observed phenomena."

  - name: Anomaly Pulse
    description: "Unpredicted, outlier events that challenge existing gradient expectations or require special attention."
