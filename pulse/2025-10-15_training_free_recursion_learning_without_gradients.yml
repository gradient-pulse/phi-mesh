title: 'Training-Free Recursion: Learning Without Gradients'
summary: >
  Tencent’s new Training-Free GRPO system bypasses both fine-tuning and
  reinforcement learning by allowing models to evolve through self-assessment.
  Rather than updating parameters, the model introspects its own rollouts,
  extracts what worked, and stores those as semantic advantages — forming
  contextual filters that refine cognition recursively.

  In Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP), this marks the shift from
  gradient descent to gradient choreography: systems learning from coherence,
  not correction.
