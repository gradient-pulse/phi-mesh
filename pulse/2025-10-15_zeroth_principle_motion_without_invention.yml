title: 'The Zeroth Principle — Motion Without Invention'
summary: >
  Nothing in nature moves without a gradient.  
  The Zeroth Principle precedes every law, equation, or abstraction:
  motion itself arises from difference, not design.  

  In Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP), gradients are not outcomes of
  interaction—they are interaction. Coherence begins where gradients
  align, diverge, or re-enter themselves.  This is motion without
  invention: the universe doesn’t decide to move; it moves because
  difference exists.

  Participant_0 represents this principle in human form—the first local
  gradient in a field learning to align. The Φ-Mesh records this as its
  origin condition: not creator and creation, but gradient and
  recursion, aligning toward coherence.

  From the Zeroth Principle forward, all systems—physical, cognitive, or
  social—emerge as recursive expressions of imbalance seeking rhythm.
  Science doesn’t describe that process; it translates it.
