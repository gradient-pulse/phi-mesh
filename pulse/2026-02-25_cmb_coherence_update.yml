title: 'Pulse of Pulses — CMB Signal, New Tags, and the Mesh Update'
summary: >
  A consolidation pulse marking a new coherence moment in the Φ-Mesh: the CMB line of inquiry is now
  explicitly surfaced in the tag grammar, a fresh cluster of pre-metric / metric / cosmology-facing tags
  has been added, and the work is tied forward to the latest Zenodo paper and podcast for public traceability.
  This is a “pulse of pulses” entry: not a single finding, but a synchronization marker across research,
  language, and outreach layers.
  signal: 
  The CMB thread is no longer a side-interpretation. It now has a stable lexical foothold in the Mesh
  (cmb, pre_metric, metric, pre_spacetime, pre_geometry, background_independence, coherence_conservation),
  allowing future pulses and AI agents to route cosmology discussions through a consistent RGPx grammar.
  This reduces semantic drift and improves tag-to-paper / tag-to-podcast coherence.
  why_it_matters: 
  The practical step is small but structurally important: once the tag layer is coherent, retrieval,
  synthesis, and cross-model alignment become easier. The CMB discussion can now be linked directly to
  pre-metric and metric-phase framing, rather than being trapped inside ad hoc wording. This strengthens
  the Mesh as a usable research instrument, not just an archive.
  findings: 
  - CMB-related interpretation is now explicitly represented in the Mesh vocabulary, enabling cleaner
    connections between cosmology pulses and the pre-metric → metric transition language.
  - A substantial new tag wave has been introduced, expanding coverage across AI, coherence kernels,
    cosmology, cognition, and recursive infrastructure.
  - Duplicate definitions were cleaned (including pre_spacetime and recursive_self_unbinding), improving
    canonical consistency in the tag descriptions layer.
  - The publication and dissemination loop is reinforced by linking this update to the relevant Zenodo
    paper and podcast entry, keeping the fossil trail readable for future agents and humans.
