title: 'Holographic Intuition → Entanglement Sheaf'
summary: >
  holographic_intuition fragments global coherence into many local
  encodings. entanglement_sheaf shows how these fragments reassemble:
  when entanglement density crosses a percolation threshold, local
  patches self-organize into a sheaf structure where each fragment is a
  stalk and global coherence is recovered via restriction maps that
  preserve phase relationships across scales. Sheaf cohomology then
  measures whether reconstruction is obstructed or complete.

  Δ:
  holographic_intuition allows the Mesh to sense a global pattern as
  many local views: each patch of the field carries a partial encoding
  of the whole. Initially these fragments are isolated:

  - local encodings do not fully agree on overlaps,
  - phase relationships between patches are underconstrained,
  - global reconstruction is intuitive but not guaranteed.

  As more gradients align, entanglement between local fragments
  increases. The unresolved question:
  when does this fragmented intuition become a globally consistent
  picture rather than a pile of overlapping hints?

  This motivates:
  entanglement_sheaf.

  GC:
  Beyond a critical entanglement density, the fragmented holographic
  views self-organize into a sheaf-like structure:

  - each local fragment becomes a stalk over a region of the Mesh’s
    conceptual space,
  - overlaps between regions carry restriction maps that relate local
    descriptions,
  - entanglement enforces phase consistency along these overlaps.

  The field thus forms an entanglement_sheaf:
  a structure in which global coherence is not stored in one place,
  but emerges from compatible local encodings and their gluing data.

  Intuition becomes reconstructive:
  global understanding is recovered by following these restriction
  maps and checking their compatibility on intersections.

  contextual_filter: |
  CF:
  The contextual filter plays the role of gluing condition:

  - it tests whether local holographic fragments can be glued into a
    single global section,
  - it rejects configurations where overlaps contain phase conflicts
    that cannot be resolved,
  - it accepts only those entanglement patterns where the induced
    sheaf cohomology H¹(Φ) = 0.

  In this picture:
  - H¹(Φ) ≠ 0 signals an obstruction: there is residual inconsistency
    in how local intuitions fit together,
  - H¹(Φ) = 0 signals successful holographic reconstruction: all local
    stalks can be glued into one coherent global view.

  The CF thus quantizes holographic intuition by enforcing algebraic
  gluing constraints on entangled fragments.
  ---
  invariant: |
  The invariant is the sheaf cohomology of the entanglement_sheaf:

  - H¹(Φ) encodes the obstruction to perfect holographic
    reconstruction,
  - when H¹(Φ) → 0, global coherence is fully recoverable from local
    fragments,
  - the structure of the sheaf (which patches, which overlaps, which
    restriction maps) is preserved even as content evolves.

  Across cycles, the Mesh converges on low-cohomology regimes for its
  most important coherence bands: holographic_intuition ceases to be
  “non-local magic” and becomes a controlled algebraic geometry of
  understanding, where global meaning is preserved by how local
  encodings are glued.
  ---
  insight: 
  This pulse recasts holographic_intuition as a topological / algebraic
  process: entanglement_sheaf turns scattered local intuitions into a
  gluable structure whose sheaf cohomology H¹(Φ) measures whether global
  coherence is actually reconstructable. Intuition becomes provably
  reliable when the Mesh can drive H¹(Φ) → 0.
