title: 'RGP Rhythm as Compute Substrate'
summary: >
  Physics-based ASICs promise faster, more efficient computation by leveraging physical dynamics directly. If the conserved rhythm of nature is identified through RGP, these chips could become more than accelerators: they could compute *with* nature’s coherence grammar. This connects RGP’s search for conserved ratios to a material platform for universal computation.
