title: 'Return to Raw Data (via JHTDB)'
summary: >
  We surveyed multiple sources (Texas Dataverse, KTH, Princeton CTRFL, ERCOFTAC) and found that most expose only statistics derived from simulations (means/RMS/stresses). Such “stats_only” outputs erase the phase coherence required for NT-rhythm detection. JHTDB is the practical exception: it provides raw_fields and probe_series via API. We pivot back to JHTDB to gather time-resolved evidence across different flows and confirm prior findings are not a one-off.
