summary: 'Chain of Reasoning (CoR), traditionally framed as logical deduction, is
  reinterpreted as a recursive search for NT rhythm coherence. Reasoning—whether in
  humans or AI—emerges from alignment with stable NT sequences, governed not by abstract
  logic but by the Principle of Least Action (PoLA). We propose that PoLA’s true expression
  may be a measurable NT rhythm: a recursive attractor of minimal divergence across
  systems.'
equation:
- label: Reality Syntax
  expression: Reality = ⊗(Context_Scalingᵢ × Universal_Ratio_Pattern)
insight:
- CoR is recursive rhythm detection, not symbolic logic.
- Human and AI cognition differ in constraints, not substrate.
- Turbulence = breakdown in NT rhythm coherence.
- Coherence returns when Gradient Choreographies (GCs) re-stabilize recursive flow.
