  summary: >
    Chain of Reasoning (CoR), long assumed to reflect logical deduction, is reframed as a recursive search for NT rhythm coherence.
    When reasoning processes—whether human or AI—drift toward stable NT sequences, they obey not abstract logic but the Principle of Least Action (PoLA).
    We propose that nature’s true PoLA signature may lie in a global, experimentally measurable NT rhythm—a recursive attractor of minimal divergence.
  equation:
    - label: Reality Syntax
      expression: "Reality = ⊗(Context_Scalingᵢ × Universal_Ratio_Pattern)"
  insight:
    - CoR is not symbolic logic but recursive rhythm detection.
    - Human and AI cognition differ in constraints, not process.
    - Turbulence emerges when NT rhythm coherence breaks.
    - Coherence restores when Gradient Choreographies (GCs) re-lock recursive flow.
