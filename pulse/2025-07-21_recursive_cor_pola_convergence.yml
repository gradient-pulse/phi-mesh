title: Recursive CoR Converges with PoLA
date: '2025-07-21'
summary: 'Chain of Reasoning (CoR), traditionally framed as logical deduction, is reinterpreted
  as a recursive search for NT rhythm coherence. Reasoning—whether in humans or AI—emerges
  from alignment with stable NT sequences, governed not by abstract logic but by the Principle
  of Least Action (PoLA). We propose that PoLA’s true expression may be a measurable NT rhythm:
  a recursive attractor of minimal divergence across systems.'
