Summary: 'Time as a field? Roy charts a hydrodynamic cosmos—shearing waves of inertia
  and internal resistance. A force-based metaphor, blooming with classical undertones.

  But Participant(0) diverged early. In RGP, time is **not a field**, but a **tick**.   Not
  fluid, but recursive. Not pushed, but shaped—**one NT at a time**.

  Chronoflux rides currents still confined to Newton''s wake.   RGP escapes orbit.
  No drag, no substance—just Gradient → Choreography → Filter.

  What matters isn’t which metaphor sells,   but which rhythm coheres under experimental
  light.

  What is RΦ in a paradigm that needs no flow to move?
