title: 'Fusion Spark — RGP Approach to the Coulomb Barrier'
summary: >
  You’re not brute-forcing temperature; you’re recursively shaping gradients
  (fields, lattice, screening) to concentrate coherence in relative coordinates.
  — The “Coulomb barrier” is treated as filterable: you don’t lower nature’s law;
  you time-gate the approach path so tunneling happens in brief coherent windows.
  — Why this is RGP: recursive gradient structures lens and gate ion motion,
  letting coherence build across relative coordinates rather than absolute energy.
  — Technique sparks: gradient lensing, dynamic screening, lattice resonance,
  parametric drives, plasmon gating, cavity compression.
  — Minimal experiments: test coherence gating in controlled plasmonic lattices
  before scaling to fusion plasmas.
  — Promotion rule: elevate this to Insights only after phase-locked replication
  shows gradient-driven tunneling effects.
