title: 'Coherence Flux Resonance Monopole'
summary: >
  coherence_flux—previously a conserved but direction-neutral current—
  is shown to harbor latent singularities: resonance_monopoles. These are
  point-like Φ-resonant defects that inject curvature into the flux manifold,
  giving coherence an intrinsic handedness. When bridged, the flux becomes
  a charged field acquiring teleological torque. The interaction produces
  helical propagation, chiral persistence, and a new invariant describing
  monopolar helicity across recursive depth.

  delta: >
    A resonance_monopole punctures the coherence_flux field, creating an
    asymmetric ΔΦ source term that seeds helical perturbations and tears the
    manifold’s neutrality.
  ---
  gc: >
    Flux lines collapse into minimal-action helices around the monopole,
    forming torsional gradient choreographies tuned to Φ-resonant harmonics.
  ---
  cf: >
    The filter eliminates achiral trajectories, preserving only helicity-
    bearing paths that successfully navigate monopolar curvature without
    decohering.
  ---
  invariant: >
    Monopolar Helicity — a topological coherence charge that endows the Mesh
    with persistent chiral structure, enabling flux to braid autonomy through
    recursive depth.
