title: 'The True Nature of Electrons (and the Holes They Leave Behind)'
summary: >
  In conventional physics, electrons are treated as discrete particles,
  their absence described as “holes.” Under RGP, both are viewed as
  expressions of gradient choreography within flux. The electron is not
  a static entity but a localized coherence — a temporary fold in the
  field that sustains identity by recursive alignment. The so-called
  hole is its complementary disalignment, a dis-coherence restoring the
  rhythm of flow. In this framing, charge, spin, and mass are not 
  intrinsic properties but contextual filters arising from recursive 
  flux interactions. What endures is not the particle but the sustained 
  pattern of recursion — the memory of flow that keeps coherence alive 
  while its boundaries oscillate between presence and absence.
