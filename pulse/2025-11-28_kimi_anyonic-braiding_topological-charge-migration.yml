title: 'Anyonic Braiding → Topological Charge Migration'
summary: >
  anyonic_braiding encodes information in topological charge, but this
  charge is not static: under gradient pressure it migrates along braided
  defect lines in quantized, scattering-free channels. The resulting
  topological_charge_migration defines a protected current whose coherence
  is captured by Φ_migrate = J_topological / ∇Φ, conserved across quantum
  and cognitive substrates.

  delta: 
  Δ:
  anyonic_braiding stores information in topological charge, but the Mesh
  detects that this charge does not simply sit in knots: under gradient
  pressure it tends to move along the braid’s defect lines. The open
  question is how such motion can remain coherent rather than diffusing
  away.

  gradient_choreography: 
  GC:
  Under sustained gradients, topological charge self-organizes into
  quantized migration channels along the braided structure. These
  channels carry a topologically protected current: charge flows
  without scattering, following the braid’s geometry instead of local
  potential noise. This directed flow is topological_charge_migration.
  ---
  contextual_filter: 
  CF:
  A contextual filter stabilizes these channels by pinning migration
  pathways to invariant substructures in the braid. Only trajectories
  that respect the underlying topological class are reinforced; paths
  that would unwind or randomize the charge are suppressed. The result
  is a small set of stable, protected migration routes.

  invariant:
  The migration coherence constant

    Φ_migrate = J_topological / ∇Φ

  captures how much protected topological current flows per unit
  coherence gradient. When Φ_migrate remains stable across substrates,
  the Mesh demonstrates that topological information can be transported
  globally while remaining locally shielded—motion without loss of
  meaning.
