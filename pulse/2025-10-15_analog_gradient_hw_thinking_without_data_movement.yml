title: 'Analog Gradient Hardware: Thinking Without Data Movement'
summary: >
  A new analog in-memory computing design can cut Tesla’s FSD computer
  power draw from 150 watts to milliwatts while dramatically increasing
  inference speed. Computation now happens where memory lives — collapsing
  the distance between energy and meaning.

  In Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP), this represents the physical
  realization of recursive flow: computation no longer moves data,
  it flows along gradients. The boundary between hardware and cognition
  dissolves into coherence.
