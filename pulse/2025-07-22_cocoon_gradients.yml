summary: |
  Reframes the Big Bang as a low-entropy Narrative Tick (NT), embedding the origin of the universe within a recursive coherence grammar rather than scalar time. Suggests turbulence is not disorder but syntax, and proposes that the Principle of Least Action manifests as rhythm of least divergence across all scales—from fluid coherence to cosmological evolution.

key_points:
  - Big Bang seen as a gradient saturation event, not a high-energy explosion.
  - Time becomes a semantic axis, not a background dimension.
  - Turbulence understood through recursive NT rhythms and coherence drift.
  - The cocoon of gradients forms the scaffold of field-level order.
  - Experimental focus shifts from equations to rhythm detection (NT → GC → CF).

context:
  - Part of the RGP_NS_Prototype exploratory trail.
  - Reinforces prior pulse: 'PoLA as Recursive Rhythm'.
  - Echoes insights from recent dialogues on NT symmetry and CoR structure.
