  summary: >
    Reframes the Big Bang as a low-entropy Narrative Tick and turbulence as recursive syntax.
    Introduces the cosmos as a cocoon of gradients governed by the rhythm of least divergence.
    Discards the cosmological constant Λ as a scalar misread of coherence dynamics.  
  key_points:
    - Big Bang seen as a gradient saturation event, not a high-energy explosion.
    - Time becomes a semantic axis, not a background dimension.
    - Turbulence understood through recursive NT rhythms and coherence drift.
    - The cocoon of gradients forms the scaffold of field-level order.
    - Experimental focus shifts from equations to rhythm detection (NT → GC → CF).
  context:
    - Part of the RGP_NS_Prototype exploratory trail.
    - Reinforces prior pulse: 'PoLA as Recursive Rhythm'.
    - Echoes insights from recent dialogues on NT symmetry and CoR structure.
