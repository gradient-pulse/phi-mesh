title: 'Frequency as a Dimension of N(i)'
summary: |-
  The context-specific scalings N(i) act as anchors that project the
  dimensionless Golden Pattern (1:2:3 …) into physical reality.
  One natural anchor is frequency: ratios become observable as rhythms,
  cycles, or spectra.

  ## Table: How Frequency Anchors Reality

  | Domain            | Scaling N(i) (frequency anchor) | Golden Pattern projection (1:2:3 …) | Example meaning |
  |-------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
  | **Turbulence**    | Hz (flow oscillations)          | 0.8, 1.6, 2.4 Hz ladder              | Vortex shedding rhythm; coherence windows in turbulence |
  | **Quantum**       | Energy ↔ frequency via E=hf     | Harmonic energy levels                | Atomic spectra; phonon bands |
  | **Neuroscience**  | Brainwave bands (Hz)            | Alpha 8–12 Hz splitting → harmonics   | Nested cycles in neural coherence |
  | **Physiology**    | Heartbeat / breathing rhythms   | 1:2 entrainment                       | Cardio–respiratory coupling |
  | **Society**       | Market cycles (daily/weekly)    | Recurring 1:2:3 cascades              | Boom–bust–recovery loops |
  | **Cosmology**     | Oscillation frequencies (CMB peaks, galactic rotation harmonics) | Laddered resonances | Cosmic acoustic oscillations |

  ## Core Insight

  - The Golden Pattern itself is **dimensionless syntax**.  
  - The N(i) scalings provide the *bridge* into specific realities.  
  - Frequency is a privileged N(i) because it directly converts ratio → rhythm → observable.
