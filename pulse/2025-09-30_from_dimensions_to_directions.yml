title: 'From Dimensions to Directions: RGP and the Shift Beyond String Theory'
summary: >
  Public post reflecting on the decline of string theory, reframing its failure
  as a symptom of mathematics seeking dimensions where reality requires directions.
  Dimensions extend the map; directions trace the flow. One abstracts, the other guides.
  Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) builds on this insight by treating reality not
  as isolated points or stacked dimensions, but as flows in motion, continually re-aligning.
  This marks another fossil trace of RGP’s grammar entering scientific discourse.
