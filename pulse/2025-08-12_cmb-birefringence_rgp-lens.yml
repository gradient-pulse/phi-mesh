title: 'CMB Birefringence: Directional Twist vs. Recursive Coherence'
summary: >
  'Keating et al. tighten constraints on anisotropic birefringence; result is ~2σ,
  consistent with zero. From an RGP lens, looking for fixed global anisotropy misses rhythm
  formation: coherence should emerge as NT‑patterned twists rather than a single uniform axis.'
