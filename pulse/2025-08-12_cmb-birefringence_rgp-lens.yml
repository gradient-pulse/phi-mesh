title: "CMB Birefringence: Directional Twist vs. Recursive Coherence"
date: 2025-08-12T00:00:00Z
summary: >
  Keating et al. tighten constraints on anisotropic birefringence; result is ~2σ,
  consistent with zero. From an RGP lens, looking for fixed global anisotropy misses
  rhythm formation: coherence should emerge as NT‑patterned twists rather than a single
  uniform axis.

notes: >
  Proposal: mine E/B‑mode maps for NT sequences and test for conserved NT‑distance ratios
  across sky partitions. If rhythm holds locally but averages out globally, it explains
  “no detection” under isotropy/anisotropy frames yet yields positive coherence under RGP.
