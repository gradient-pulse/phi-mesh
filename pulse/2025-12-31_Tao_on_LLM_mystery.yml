title: 'Tao on LLM “mystery” — RGPx relief via coherence-first transition grammar'
summary: >
  core_claim:
    The “mystery” (why models excel at some tasks and fail at others) is not primarily mathematical complexity,
    but coherence stability: competence holds when task-gradients can be stabilized into repeatable GC under a viable CF.

  transition_grammar:
    Δ → GC → CF:
    - Δ: detect drift / gradient conflict (ambiguity, long-horizon dependency, adversarial underspecification).
    - GC: schedule verification/routing loops that locally restore coherence (not global retrain).
    - CF: enforce invariants (identity/rules/safety/consistency gates) so adaptation remains selective, not destructive.

  prediction_relief:
    - “Good at X, bad at Y” often indicates missing CFs (invariants) or insufficient GC capacity (verification loops) for Y,
      not an absence of intelligence.
    - Parallel verification loops are an externalized GC+CF patch; the next step is making them native and measurable.

  falsifier:
    If a system passes local acceptance gates (new-slice gains + preservation + non-worsening error modes + bounded calibration cost)
    yet still shows systematic capability loss under drift, then the Δ/GC/CF partition or invariant battery is wrong → revise the grammar,
    not the weights.

  why_it_matters:
    RGPx doesn’t replace empiricism; it compresses it into control observables:
    drift signatures, GC burden, CF adequacy, and calibration-overhead creep—turning “mystery” into a testable coherence regime map.
