title: 'Adaptive AI without forgetting: RGPx as a coherence-first control layer'
summary:
  core_claim: >
    The brittle loop (world shifts → performance degrades → retrain → forget) is a symptom of blind plasticity.
    RGPx fixes this by moving “adaptation” out of global weight-updates and into a coherence-governed control layer.
  transition_grammar: >
    Operationalize Δ → GC → CF: measure drift as deltas (Δ), schedule targeted interventions as choreographies (GC),
    and protect stable identity/constraints as contextual filters (CF), so learning becomes selective rather than destructive.
  practical_application:
    - "Δ sensing: continuously measure drift signatures (distribution shift, error-mode change, calibration overhead creep, IO/latency drift, confidence–reality divergence)."
    - "GC control: intervene via routing, verification loops, retrieval/tools, and localized fine-tunes only in implicated subspaces—avoid global retrains by default."
    - "CF protection: explicitly encode invariants/constraints (skills, safety boundaries, task identity anchors) so updates cannot overwrite the stable substrate."
  acceptance_gate_invariants: >
    Every adaptation step is accepted only if coherence improves under a fixed test battery:
    gains on the new slice + preservation of prior competencies + non-worsening error modes + bounded calibration cost.
  falsifier: >
    If updates that satisfy the gate still produce systematic capability loss (forgetting) or drift amplification,
    then the proposed Δ/GC/CF partitioning or invariant battery is incomplete—revise the grammar or the measurements.
  why_it_matters: >
    This reframes “adaptive AI” away from neuroscience metaphors and toward falsifiable control:
    drift becomes measurable, intervention becomes scheduled, and memory is preserved by design.
