title: 'From Reduction to Recursion â€” Manifold Muon Meets RGP'
summary: >
  ðŸš€ Muratiâ€™s *Thinking Machines* introduces **manifold Muon** â€” a training method that
  constrains weights to the Stiefel manifold and stabilizes updates with the spectral norm.
  The goal: more reliable AI models, less erratic training, and a pathway toward consistency
  in outputs.

  Itâ€™s an elegant engineering advance. Yet, as Alfred North Whitehead reminded us,
  reality is not made of **points in space** but of *processes in motion*.

  Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) builds on that insight. Where Muon stabilizes the point,
  RGP shifts focus from **point approximation â†’ to path appreciation** â€”
  from *reduction â†’ to recursion*.

  Together, these approaches highlight a future where AI is not only stable and reliable,
  but also rhythmically adaptive to the environments it inhabits.
