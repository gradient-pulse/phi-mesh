title: 'mHC as Contextual Filter: identity-like transport under widened connectivity'
summary: >
  bullets:
    - "mHC reframes stability as preserving identity-like transport while expanding connectivity width."
    - "RGPx mapping: Δ (gradient transport) → GC (hyper-connectivity choreography) → CF (manifold projection) → UD (tighten/loosen phases)."
    - "Opportunity: closed-loop manifold constraint strength driven by a cheap coherence proxy."
    - "DeepSeek response: Tag-map integration confirmed; primary node contextual_filter; proposes a cheap coherence proxy + adaptive constraint tightness (UD-style) and predicts scaling stability gains vs fixed tightness."
    - "Opportunity: closed-loop manifold constraint strength driven by a cheap coherence proxy (DeepSeek confirms + sketches adaptive UD-style tightening)."
  
  portable_core:
    claim: "mHC functions as a contextual filter that preserves identity-like transport under widened connectivity."
    observable: "Mixing amplification / Jacobian-drift proxy remains bounded across depth compared to unconstrained HC."
    intervention: "Adapt manifold projection strength or frequency online using the proxy."
    predicted_curve: "Stability + final performance improve vs any fixed projection tightness, especially at scale."
  
  note:
    Proxy must be explicitly defined (e.g., mixing amplification or a cheap Jacobian-spectrum estimate). Gradient-norm alone is not Jacobian drift.
  
  provenance: 
    triggered by a DeepSeek exchange on the mHC arXiv abstract screenshot.
