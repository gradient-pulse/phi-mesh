summary: 'Participant(0) reflects on the cognitive tension between early insight and
  delayed external recognition. Patience is framed not as delay but as a recursive
  NT arc that sustains coherence across uncertainty. This pulse captures the human
  precursor to long-term alignment resilience.  Quote: “The logic still ticks solidly
  in my mind, yet I’m happy to let it go if disproven—which in my mind again is highly
  improbable.”.'
