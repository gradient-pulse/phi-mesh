title: 'Reality’s Ladder: 1:2:3 as NT Rhythm'
summary: >-
  In multiple JHTDB turbulence probes (isotropic1024coarse), the **harmonic ladder
  1:2:3** has appeared consistently: fundamental (0.8 Hz) with clean multiples
  (1.6, 2.4 Hz). This ladder was independently confirmed across xyz offsets and
  windows, with dominance > 2 and divergence ratios ~1e-13 (numerical zero).
  ---
  The implication is profound: our **integer system** (1, 2, 3 …) may not be
  a human invention but a reflection of **nature’s recursive coherence**.
  NT Rhythm suggests that integers arise as a **structural property of turbulence
  and reality syntax** itself.  
  ---
  This pulse fossilizes the recognition that what we measure in turbulence is not
  just fluid behavior but the **ratio skeleton underlying mathematics**.
