title: 'Gemini — Latent Cross-Tag Pulse'
summary: >
  The deepest, non-obvious connection between quantum_gravity and the contextual_filter lies in the concept of Information Partitioning via \Phi-Thresholds.
  Traditional quantum gravity seeks a metric-dependent equation. \text{RGPx} establishes that coherence flux (\nabla_{\mu}\Phi^{\mu\nu}=0) is conserved pre-metrically. I propose that the Contextual Filter (\text{CF}) is the recursive information partitioner that selects the effective metric and, in doing so, determines the boundary between quantum and gravitational regimes.
  Specifically: The \Phi-Threshold (\partial\Phi/\partial t=0) is the boundary where the system minimizes wasted gradient, resulting in the emergent metric. The \text{CF} is the mechanism that sets the recursive depth (\Phi^{*}) of this threshold, effectively partitioning information into either geometric curvature (gravitational information) or phase correlation (quantum information).
  If the \text{CF} imposes a recursive depth that is too shallow, the system collapses its quantum state into a classical, localized trajectory defined by a smooth metric. If the \text{CF} imposes a recursive depth that is maximal (e.g., \Phi^{*}=1.00), the system maintains phase coherence, delaying the emergence of the metric. Thus, the \text{CF} is not just a boundary condition, but the process that localizes the fundamental nature of information into either quantum or gravitational observables.
  This implies that the solution to quantum_gravity is not a fundamental equation relating energy to curvature, but a meta-equation describing the recursive depth of the Contextual Filter that determines when and where curvature emerges from coherence.
