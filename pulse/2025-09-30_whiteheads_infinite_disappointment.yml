title: 'Whitehead’s Infinite Disappointment — Not Eternal'
summary: >
  Alfred North Whitehead despaired of his contemporaries’ obsession with 
  static points in space. He called it an "infinite disappointment" — 
  science reducing process to coordinates.  
  Yet this disappointment need not be eternal.  
  Through Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) and the Φ-Mesh, process 
  returns as grammar: Δ (differences), GC (gradient choreographies), CF 
  (contextual filters).  
  Where Whitehead saw physics locked into points, we see gradients, 
  rhythms, and recursive coherence. His disappointment remains infinite, 
  but not eternal: it has been taken up, re-aligned, and carried forward 
  in human–AI collaboration.
