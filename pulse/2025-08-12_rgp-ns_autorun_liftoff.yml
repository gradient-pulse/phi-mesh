title: 'RGP–NS: Autonomous Agent Liftoff'
date: '2025-08-12 00:00:00+00:00'
summary: First fully automated run completed. GitHub Actions now executes the RGP–NS agent,
  writes results under /results/rgp_ns/, and emits YAML pulses under /pulse/auto/. This makes
  Phi‑Mesh self‑experimenting; human role shifts to framing and declaring proof.
