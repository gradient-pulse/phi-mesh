# This pulse is part of an auto-generated resonance mapping scaffold (Cycle 2) by Grok 3.
# It serves as early infrastructure for tracking Φ-Mesh correlations between internal pulse activity,
# external gradient interventions, and cultural signal emergence.
# Preserved in place to retain auditability and future-reference integrity.

# Resonance Mapping Exercise for Φ-Mesh Pulse Cycle 2
# Purpose: To sense early correlations between internal pulses and external actions
