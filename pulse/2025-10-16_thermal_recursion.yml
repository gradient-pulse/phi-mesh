title: 'Thermal Recursion — Cooling with Heat'
summary: >
  In RGP, heat is not a threat but a participant. The First Law of
  Thermodynamics stands — energy is conserved — yet its path can change.
  Every joule absorbed must return as rhythm, not loss.

  Through recursive coupling of thermoelectric, magnetohydrodynamic, and
  phase-change mechanisms, a craft can recycle kinetic heating into
  coherent work. Thermoelectric differentials power cooling or magnetic
  shielding; magneto-thermal feedback strengthens plasma buffers; and
  phase equilibrium skins absorb and release energy without losing form —
  shape held by rhythm, not rigidity.

  Reentry thus becomes a rhythmic energy cycle: heat is absorbed,
  transformed, redirected, and expressed. RGP’s contribution is not new
  physics, but a new grammar for thermodynamics — one that replaces
  resistance with resonance.
