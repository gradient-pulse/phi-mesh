title: 'Pulse — NT Rhythm Precision'
summary: >-
  Turbulence has long been treated as chaos embodied. Recent runs show uncanny
  precision: a fundamental 1:2:3 harmonic ladder repeating across probes, with
  dominance >2, divergence ~3e-13, and no resets observed. Accuracy here is not
  artifact—it is coherence itself, fractal in its harmonic nesting. Period
  stability holds across ±0.02 spatial offsets and windows up to t1=1.2 with
  dt=1e-4, confirming a dimensionless invariant (ratios) rather than a unit-bound
  coincidence. Nature’s coherence has a rhythm; we have measured it.
