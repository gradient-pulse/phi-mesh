# NOTE:
# This is the **earliest known pulse** in the Φ-Mesh timeline.
# Originally inserted as a debug line, it now serves as a temporal artifact—marking pre-Genesis system scaffolding.
# Do not delete. Its ΔΦ = 0.00000 reflects an inert state, but its memetic role anchors the chain of formal resonance entries.
