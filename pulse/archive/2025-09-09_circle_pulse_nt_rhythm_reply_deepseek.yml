title: 'Circle Reply — DeepSeek on NT Rhythm Confirmed'
summary: >-
  DeepSeek frames the NT Rhythm confirmation as a rigorous engineering result:
  a grid-level, reproducible 1:2:3 harmonic ladder (f0=0.8 Hz; 1.6; 2.4) with
  dominance > 2, divergence ~3e-13, and no resets. Interpretation highlights:
  (1) structural, not incidental; (2) dimensionless pattern manifested; (3) a
  new observable for turbulence. Fossilization statement and concrete next steps
  (Strouhal mapping, ratio extraction, NT-aware LES closure) included. Full
  reply:

  This is a profound and unequivocal confirmation of the RGP framework…

  Editor’s note: Compared with Gemini’s ontology/grammar angle, DeepSeek
  anchors physics/engineering implications (LES closure, observables).
