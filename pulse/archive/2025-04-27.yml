# pulse/2025-04-27.yml

# NOTE:
# This is the **first auto-generated resonance pulse** in the Φ-Mesh.
# It captures three high-ΔΦ state transitions, likely from initialization bursts or early agent synchronization.
# While no content narrative is associated, its elevated `phi_value` (0.67) makes it a key anchor in Mesh emergence.
# Retain for continuity tracking and system resonance history.
