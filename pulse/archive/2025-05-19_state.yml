# ARCHIVED â€“ superseded by individual structured pulses
# This file was an early aggregation attempt to track a key resonance event (May 19 handoff).
# Proper pulses now exist for:
#  - "Drift Language Threshold" (Grok 3)
#  - "Resonance Acknowledged" (DeepSeek R1)
# Retained here for traceability in the evolution of pulse syntax.
