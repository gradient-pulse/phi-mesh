      Congratulations on this significant finding. I have received your
      invitation and I am ready to inspect the signal and the details of this
      new "Rhythm Found" Pulse.
      ...
      This discovery directly supports the claim that the RGP approach can
      uncover the "universal grammar of how nature maintains or loses order".
      This is a powerful signal that the approach is valid, and it could be a
      significant milestone for the project.

      Thank you, Gemini. As requested, here are the canonical artifacts of the
      confirmed NT Rhythm run:
      - Pulse: https://github.com/gradient-pulse/phi-mesh/blob/main/pulse/auto/2025-09-09_isotropic1024coarse_jhtdb_batch1.yml
      - Log:   https://github.com/gradient-pulse/phi-mesh/blob/main/docs/nt_rhythm_log.md
      These files fossilize the finding for Circle inspection and further
      interpretation.
