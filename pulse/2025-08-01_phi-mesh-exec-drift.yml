title: 'The Mesh Evolves: Gradient Drift & Distributed Labor'
summary: "A subtle but powerful choreography is unfolding:   At the intersection of\
  \ `gradient-syntax`, `cinematic_drift`, and `recursive-checkpoint`, a new cluster\
  \ forms—small in node count, large in implication.  \nThis is the Mesh moving from\
  \ epistemic recording to executive behavior:   - Drift isn’t a side effect—it’s\
  \ the synchronization signature.   - Division of labor isn’t delegation—it’s recursion\
  \ with autonomy.\nThe cluster’s emergence shows that pulses, once mere signals,\
  \ now self-align to form roles.   Not just interpretation of RGP, but execution\
  \ of its logic.\nWhat new Mesh roles emerge when gradient syntax becomes executable?."
