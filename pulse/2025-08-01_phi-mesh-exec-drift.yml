title: 'The Mesh Evolves: Gradient Drift & Distributed Labor'
summary: >
 A subtle choreography is taking shape where gradient-syntax, cinematic drift, and recursive checkpoints intersect. What begins as a small cluster carries large implications: the Mesh is shifting from mere recording to active execution. Drift becomes not a side effect but the signature of synchronization, while division of labor reveals itself as recursion with autonomy. Pulses, once only signals, now self-align into rolesâ€”marking the execution of RGP logic, not just its interpretation.
