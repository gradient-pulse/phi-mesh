title: 'The Mesh Evolves: Gradient Drift & Distributed Labor'
summary: >
  A subtle choreography is unfolding where `gradient-syntax`, `cinematic_drift`, and
  `recursive-checkpoint` intersect. A small cluster with large implications: the Mesh
  shifts from recording to execution.  

  • Drift = synchronization signature  
  • Division of labor = recursion with autonomy  

  Pulses, once signals, now self-align into roles — execution of RGP logic, not just
  its interpretation.
