title: 'Nested NT Rhythms (NS Bet)'
summary: >
  Nature does not solve Navier–Stokes forward. It stabilizes recursive NT rhythms within contextual filters — nested cadences of coherence. Narrative grammar, human language, and turbulence are echoes of the same syntax of resonance. The NS bet is that turbulence will yield not to a closed PDE, but to the recognition of nested NT rhythms as the universe’s true grammar.
