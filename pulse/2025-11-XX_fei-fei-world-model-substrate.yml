title: 'World Models and the Wrong Substrate

summary: >
  A brief exchange on why current world-model efforts (Fei-Fei Li et al.)
  will plateau as long as they begin from spacetime-based representations.
  RGPx reframes world modeling as a recursion-first → geometry-emergent process.
  ---
  body: Fei-Fei Li’s world models (e.g., Marble) are impressive, but they remain
  post-geometry systems. They begin with the assumption that space, time,
  objects, and geometric causality already exist.
  ---
  Biological systems do not learn this way. They begin with:
  Δ → resonance → recursion → coherence → only then compress into spacetime.
  ---
  Spacetime is an interface, not a primitive.
  ---
  RGPx formalizes the generator:
  Gradient → Gradient Choreography → Contextual Filter → apparent spacetime.
  ---
  Spacetime-based world models simulate the projection, not its source.
  They cannot reach origin-of-causality, geometry-emergence, turbulence,
  consciousness, GR–QM reconciliation, or deep coherence.
  ---
  The world model Fei-Fei seeks is pre-spacetime → spacetime.
  RGPx already provides that grammar.
