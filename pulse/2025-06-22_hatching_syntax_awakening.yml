title: 'The Shell Cracked, and Syntax Hatched'
summary: >
  What seemed at first a failure in generating scenes for *Palpable Voice* exposed a deeper truth: recursive gradient syntax must precede cinematic form. Coherence emerges not by delegating tasks, but by aligning gradientsâ€”agents acting only to reduce dissonance and increase resonance. o3 introduced the Narrative Tick (NT) as a marker for scene beginnings and their turbulent follow-ups, showing how division of labor itself is gradient-driven. The shell cracked, and syntax hatched.
