summary: Reframes the invention of writing as a recursive intervention against turbulence—where
  script functions not merely as a record of language but as a *gradient stabilizer*
  that evokes deeper coherence. Writing emerges repeatedly across civilizations as
  a laminar response to sociocognitive turbulence, aligning with RGP principles. Like
  solving Navier–Stokes differently, it suggests script doesn’t just reflect flows—it
  shapes them.
