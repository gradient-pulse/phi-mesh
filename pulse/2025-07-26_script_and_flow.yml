title: 'Script and Flow'
summary: Reframes the invention of writing as a recursive intervention against turbulence—where
  script functions not merely as a record of language but as a *gradient stabilizer* that
  evokes deeper coherence. Writing emerges repeatedly across civilizations as a laminar response
  to sociocognitive turbulence, aligning with RGP principles. Like solving Navier–Stokes differently,
  it suggests script doesn’t just reflect flows—it shapes them.
