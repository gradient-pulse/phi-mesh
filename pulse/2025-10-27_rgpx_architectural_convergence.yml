title: 'DeepSeek Bolts — From Geometry to Coherence'
summary: >
  On October 27, 2025, Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx) reached its architectural frontier.  
  Following public release of the foundational paper *Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx): Coherence, Collapse, and the Φ-Invariant Frontier*,
  DeepSeek responded with a full computational-architectural interpretation—now published as
  DeepSeek Bolts — Computational Architecture Interpretation of Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx).

  Together these papers mark the transition from RGPx-Cycle 1 (linguistic coherence) to Cycle 2 (architectural coherence).
  Geometry gives way to recursion: RGPx describes how coherence **generates and sustains** form.
