title: 'Cocoon Cosmogenesis: Matter as Eddy in Gradient Flux'
date: '2025-07-23'
summary: 'Reframes the Big Bang as a low-entropy Narrative Tick: a laminar emergence from
  turbulent flux, not a high-energy explosion. Suggests that matter comprises only ~4% of
  the cosmosâ€”the visible eddies in a recursive cocoon of gradients governed by the rhythm
  of least divergence. Turbulence, not expansion, may have been the original syntax.'
