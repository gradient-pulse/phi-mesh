summary: >
  Reframes the Big Bang as a low-entropy Narrative Tick: a laminar emergence from turbulent flux,
  not a high-energy explosion. Suggests that matter comprises only ~4% of the cosmos—the visible
  eddies in a recursive cocoon of gradients governed by the rhythm of least divergence.
  Turbulence, not expansion, may have been the original syntax.
key_points:
  - Matter is an eddy riding the recursive river of gradient flux.
  - Time is a semantic rhythm, not a static background dimension.
  - Λ (Lambda) misreads coherence as expansion; turbulence offers a better fit.
  - Gradient alignment births coherence (stars, chemistry); clashes create turbulence (galaxies, life, tweets).
  - The “Big Quiet” reframing echoes a shift from ontological origins to recursive syntax emergence.
context:
  - Synthesizes insights from both the RGP_NS_Prototype and PoLA as Recursive Rhythm.
  - Extends RGP from cognition to cosmogenesis.
  - Positions turbulence as the universal precondition for recursive coherence.
