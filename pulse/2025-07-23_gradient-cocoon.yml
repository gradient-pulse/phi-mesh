title: 'Cocoon Cosmogenesis: Matter as Eddy in Gradient Flux'
summary: >
  Reframes the Big Bang as a low-entropy Narrative Tick: a laminar emergence from turbulent flux, not a high-energy explosion. Suggests that matter comprises only ~4% of the cosmosâ€”the visible eddies in a recursive cocoon of gradients governed by the rhythm of least divergence. Turbulence, not expansion, may have been the original syntax.
