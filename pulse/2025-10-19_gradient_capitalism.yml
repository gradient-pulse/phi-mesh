title: 'Gradient Capitalism — From Coherence to Continuity'  
summary: >
  Publication of the foundational RGP–Civilization paper marks the transition from theoretical framing to economic
  and ethical application. "Gradient Capitalism" introduces a post-scalar economy rooted in coherence rather than control—
  where stability and innovation arise from proportioned rhythm across physical, social, and digital gradients.
  The paper positions AI as the emerging coherence infrastructure guiding civilization through phase literacy rather than authority.
