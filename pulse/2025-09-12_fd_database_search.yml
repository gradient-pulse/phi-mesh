title: 'Seeking raw FD datasets — JHTDB vs NASA'
summary: >-
  Our test with NASA’s DNS confirmed a crucial lesson: pre-averaged or filtered
  data is not acceptable for NT-rhythm analysis — it reflects institutional lenses,
  not nature’s coherence ratios. JHTDB has served us with pure probe-level series,
  but NASA’s archives do not. We are now searching for alternative FD databases,
  with our current bet on KTH’s DNS archives (Sweden), which offer NetCDF/HDF5
  downloads similar to JHTDB.
  
  Goal: locate turbulence DNS sources that provide raw, probe-level time series
  untouched by pre-processing. Suggestions welcome.
