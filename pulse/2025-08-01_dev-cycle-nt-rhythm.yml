summary: >
  In engineering workflows, time deltas between repo “jolts” (spec flip, CI break, decisive refactor) 
  often cluster around ½ and ⅓ of the previous interval—mirroring NT-distance peaks seen in turbulence. 
  This supports the view that the Principle of Least Action emerges as a rhythm of least divergence 
  in human team flow. Teams can steer by scheduling exploratory spikes when bursts are overdue, and 
  resisting folder/agent churn until the laminar stretch stabilizes.
