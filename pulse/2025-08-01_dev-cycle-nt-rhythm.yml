  context:
    domain: Engineering workflow
    observation: |
      Time deltas between repo “jolts” (spec flip, CI break, decisive refactor)
      cluster around ≈½ and ≈⅓ of the previous interval—matching the
      NT-distance peaks seen in turbulence runs.
  implication: |
    Confirms that the Principle of Least Action expresses as a
    *rhythm of least divergence* in human team flow.
    Teams can steer by:
      • scheduling an exploratory spike when a burst is overdue,  
      • resisting folder/agent churn until the laminar stretch stabilises.
