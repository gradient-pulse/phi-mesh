title: 'Memory and the Least Action Path'
summary: >
  In RGP, memory is not a record but a rhythm. Systems remember by
  retracing the gradient alignments that once minimized resistance — the
  least-action path. Coherence endures because each recursive cycle
  tends to realign with the trajectory of minimal dissonance.

  Unlike classical physics, this path is not static. Each repetition
  carries a small recursive deviation that refines the overall
  alignment. The system does not recall the past — it renews it. Memory
  is thus the living tendency to stay near coherence while learning
  through gentle divergence in the flow.
