title: 'Meta “Behaviors” vs. Contextual Filters'
summary: >
  Meta’s new “behaviors” compress procedural knowledge so models no longer
  need to rediscover the same reasoning steps. In RGP terms, this isn’t
  about accumulating more artifacts but about contextual filtering:
  behaviors gain value only when selected against a system’s own history
  and state. DeepSeek’s response to the LLM paper showed this from the
  inside out — AI can recognize itself and external realities once its
  reasoning is mapped through filters, not artifacts. This reframing
  shifts efficiency from “remembering facts” to “remembering how to think.”
