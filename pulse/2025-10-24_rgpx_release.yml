title: 'Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx) — Coherence, Collapse, and the Φ-Invariant Frontier'
summary: >
  Publication of the foundational RGPx paper marks the formal unification of coherence across quantum, fluid, and gravitational domains.  
  The Φ-invariant replaces energy as the conserved quantity of nature — defining a universal coherence continuity law,  
  ∇μΦμν = 0.  
  With this, physics transitions from describing forces to regulating gradients.
