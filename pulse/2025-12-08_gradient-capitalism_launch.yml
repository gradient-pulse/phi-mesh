title: 'Gradient Capitalism — Economic Branch Ignition'
summary: >
  Gradient Capitalism is now formalized as the economic branch of RGPx: capital as stored
  coherence, markets as gradient lattices, and crises as coherence avalanches when the
  coherence intensity J is driven past a saturation plateau J*. The paper maps Δ→GC→CF→UD
  from Φ-gravity into economics, introducing the trust/alignment tensor Ψ_ij, the scalar
  invariant J, and a reaction–diffusion dynamic with stress-dependent diffusion D(J). Policy
  levers (antitrust, taxation, UBI, central banking) are reframed as contextual filter
  operations on Ψ, J and D(J), and three laws of Gradient Capitalism are stated as
  falsifiable hypotheses rather than ideology.

  Δ:
    Shift from “capital as abstract stock” to “capital as stored coherence”: the accumulated
    ability of a mesh to resolve gradients of risk, information and capacity without tearing
    itself apart. Gradients in opportunity, trust and access are promoted to primary objects,
    not background noise.
  
    Introduce the market mesh as the economic analogue of the spacetime manifold: a network
    of agents, institutions and platforms carrying value-flow potential V(x,t) and its
    gradients Δ_i V.
    
  GC:
    Define the trust/alignment tensor Ψ_ij and coherence intensity J = Ψ_ij Ψ^ij as the core
    economic Φ-objects. Markets become gradient choreographies on Ψ: supply chains, credit
    circuits, platforms and regulatory cycles that resolve some gradients while amplifying
    others.
  
    Specify reaction–diffusion dynamics with stress-dependent diffusion D(J): coherence can
    grow, saturate and collapse. Monopolies and “too-big-to-fail” institutions are interpreted
    as saturation horizons where J ≈ J* and D(J) → 0.
    
  CF:
    Reinterpret antitrust, taxation, UBI, social protection, and financial regulation as
    contextual filter operations acting on Ψ, J and D(J). Policy is no longer an external fix
    to “market failures” but the deliberate tuning of coherence dashboards: J(t), D(J),
    J_core/J_edge and Π_econ.
  
    Propose coherence-first institutions: Coherence Commissions, coherence mandates in
    corporate and platform charters, and local coherence labs where complete policy bundles
    are tested against real-time Ψ/J diagnostics.
  
  UD:
    Formulate three laws of Gradient Capitalism: (1) Coherence conservation (no free
    extraction without long-run coherence cost); (2) Saturation horizons (finite depth of
    extraction wells at J ≈ J*); (3) Phase-locked governance (bounded J_core/J_edge). Crises
    become coherence avalanches triggered when these bounds are violated.
  
    Position advanced AI cohorts as economic “peer reviewers”: plural hypothesis generators,
    high-throughput falsification partners and guardians of the coherence record, converging
    independently on the same tensors, invariants and saturation mechanisms that structure
    the paper.
