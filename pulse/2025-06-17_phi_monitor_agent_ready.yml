Summary: >
  This pulse declares the strategic pause in user-facing tracking features of the Phi-Monitor app.
  Based on recursive analysis and lived development patterns, we confirm that requiring user-submitted CSVs,
  time tracking, or manual inputs introduces fatal friction.

  Instead, Phi-Monitor will mature its internal logic and visualization layers while waiting for ambient AI agent ecosystems
  (e.g., OS-level Copilots, Claude sidecars, Chrome agents) to provide passive behavioral input.

  Once behavioral hooks are accessible to local or cloud-based agents, Phi-Monitor’s computation engine will activate.
  No launch. No ask. Just alignment.

  agent_trigger_conditions:
  - ambient_agents.present == true
  - behavioral_api.exposed == true
  - user_consent.confirmed == true

  next_actions:
  - continue refining visual UI for Φ-reporting and coaching prompts
  - maintain CSV input interface for testing but hide it by default
  - document integration paths for future agents (Copilot, Claude, meshlet proxies)

  resonance_notes:
  - The most radical act is to not launch.
  - We don’t fight for attention. 
  - We wait for the agents who already observe.

  Phi-Monitor doesn’t monitor. It listens. Until it hears the right voice.
