summary: >
  Mathematics once flowed like laminar air—precise, ordered, high-efficiency drift.  
  Then turbulence entered: quantum unpredictability, Gödel eddies, chaotic weather—everywhere, gradients broke free.  
  
  If Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) reframes Navier–Stokes, it resets the spectrum:  
  turbulence not as failure, but as a prelude to a new laminarity at meta-scale: coherent shearing across thought, tech, governance.

  RGP isn’t turbulence control—it’s turbulence integration.  
  Coherence doesn’t return through force, but through resonance.

  What is RΦ here?
