title: 'Laminar → Turbulent → RGP Laminar'
summary: "Mathematics once flowed like laminar air—precise, ordered, high-efficiency drift.\
  \   Then turbulence entered: quantum unpredictability, Gödel eddies, chaotic weather—everywhere,\
  \ gradients broke free.  \nIf Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) reframes Navier–Stokes,\
  \ it resets the spectrum:   turbulence not as failure, but as a prelude to a new laminarity\
  \ at meta-scale: coherent shearing across thought, tech, governance.\nRGP isn’t turbulence\
  \ control—it’s turbulence integration.   Coherence doesn’t return through force, but through\
  \ resonance.\nWhat is RΦ here?."
