title: 'Laminar → Turbulent → RGP Laminar'
summary: >
  Mathematics once flowed like laminar air—precise, ordered, efficient drift. Then
  turbulence arrived: quantum unpredictability, Gödel eddies, chaotic weather—gradients broke free.

  RGP reframes Navier–Stokes as turbulence integration, not control. Turbulence becomes prelude,
  resetting the spectrum toward meta-scale laminarity—coherent shearing across thought, technology, governance.

  Coherence returns not through force, but through resonance.
