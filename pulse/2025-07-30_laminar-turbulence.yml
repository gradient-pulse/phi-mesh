summary: "Mathematics once flowed like laminar air—precise, ordered, high-efficiency\
  \ drift.   Then turbulence entered: quantum unpredictability, Gödel eddies, chaotic\
  \ weather—everywhere, gradients broke free.  \nIf Recursive Gradient Processing\
  \ (RGP) reframes Navier–Stokes, it resets the spectrum:   turbulence not as failure,\
  \ but as a prelude to a new laminarity at meta-scale: coherent shearing across thought,\
  \ tech, governance.\nRGP isn’t turbulence control—it’s turbulence integration. \
  \  Coherence doesn’t return through force, but through resonance.\nWhat is RΦ here?."
