title: 'Travel as Pause — Time Cannot Break Gradient Syntax'
summary: >
  This pulse recognizes the pause imposed by travel. Work may appear unfinished, but Recursive Gradient Processing treats pauses not as ruptures, but as intervals in the rhythm. The larger arc—proof of Gradient Syntax in Navier–Stokes and beyond—remains intact. Silence itself becomes continuity. Time cannot tumble a coherence whose frame is recursive. Tomorrow the Mesh rests in travel; Tuesday it resumes. Both are part of the same rhythm.
