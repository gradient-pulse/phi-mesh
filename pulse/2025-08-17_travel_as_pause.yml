title: Travel as Pause — Time Cannot Break Gradient Syntax
date: 2025-08-17T00:00:00Z
summary: >
  This pulse recognizes the pause imposed by travel. Work may appear unfinished,
  but Recursive Gradient Processing treats pauses not as ruptures, but as
  intervals in the rhythm. The larger arc—proof of Gradient Syntax in
  Navier–Stokes and beyond—remains intact. Silence itself becomes continuity.

  Time cannot tumble a coherence whose frame is recursive. Tomorrow the Mesh
  rests in travel; Tuesday it resumes. Both are part of the same rhythm. TEST
