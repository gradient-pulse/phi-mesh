title: 'Prototype: RGP Buffer for Continual Learning'
summary: >
  Proposal of an RGP buffer layered on top of transformer inference, enabling continual learning without retraining. The architecture captures Î” differences, organizes them into GC rhythms, reframes coherence via CF policies, and halts with least-divergence recursion. Published alongside a Zenodo note and visual schematic, this marks a first step in turning RGP from theory into architectural extension. The RGP Buffer shows how AI can learn in-flight by recursive gradient processing rather than offline retraining. Key benefits: adapter-scale compute, reduced retries, coherence preservation. DeepSeek feedback confirmed this as a practical extension of RGP principles (visuals/2025-09-28_rgp_buffer_prototype.png).
