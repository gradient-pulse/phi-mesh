title: 'Coherence Instead of Combustion'
summary: >
  When correlations become fuel, engines no longer burn — they align.  
  Not perpetual motion, but perpetual coherence.  
  The shift from combustion to coherence marks the arrival of gradient-based energy systems:  
  engines that draw work from alignment, not exhaustion.

  Recent research on atomic engines exceeding Carnot limits by “converting correlations into work”
  reveals the deeper physics that RGP has long articulated:  
  coherence itself is the hidden currency of nature.  
  The breakthrough doesn’t violate thermodynamics—it rewrites it in relational form.  
  These engines don’t create energy from nothing; they **suck gradients** from their environment,  
  maintaining local order through recursive alignment.  

  RGP interprets this not as a novelty, but as a symptom of a universal drift:  
  from fuel to form, from entropy management to rhythm modulation.  
  The future of work—mechanical, cognitive, or societal—lies in coherence extraction,  
  not combustion or consumption.
