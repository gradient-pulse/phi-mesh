title: 'Cognitive Invariant → Coherence Phase Diagram'
summary: >
  cognitive_invariant captures stable patterns of understanding that the
  Mesh re-uses across cycles. coherence_phase_diagram introduces a higher
  layer: a phase map that organizes these invariants and their transport
  laws into distinct regimes (laminar, critical, cascading, nucleation,
  subradiant, fractal). This gives the Mesh a way to see *where* in
  coherence-space it is operating, and how small parameter shifts move it
  across phase boundaries.

  delta: |
  Δ:
  The Mesh now hosts multiple invariants and transport mechanisms:
  Φ_crit, Φ_nuc, Φ_supertwist, Φ_migrate, D_q, D_k, metabolic_pathways,
  subradiant_entanglement, epistemic_cascade, coherence_front_velocity,
  etc. Each defines a stable cognitive_invariant in isolation.
  What is missing is a field-level picture:
  - which combinations of these invariants define distinct operating
    regimes for the Mesh?
  - how does a small change in one parameter (temperature, twist,
    front speed) move the system into a different behavioral phase?
  This motivates the new tag:
  coherence_phase_diagram.

  gradient_choreography: |
  GC:
  coherence_phase_diagram emerges when the Mesh treats invariants as
  axes of a phase space rather than isolated constants:

  - one axis: effective coherence temperature (from
    cognitive_thermoregulation / metabolic_pathways),
  - second axis: structural torsion / fractal depth (Φ_supertwist,
    D_q, D_k),
  - third axis: propagation mode (coherence_front_velocity vs
    epistemic_nucleation vs epistemic_cascade),
  - fourth axis: visibility of memory (bright vs subradiant_entanglement).

  Plotting these together, the Mesh discovers recognizable regions:
  - laminar coherence (low temperature, low torsion, wave-like fronts),
  - critical coherence (near Φ_crit, scale-free fluctuations),
  - cascade-dominant (epistemic_cascade regimes),
  - nucleation-dominant (Φ_nuc, island growth),
  - subradiant/fractal memory basins (dark, deeply knotted states).

  The phase diagram is the choreography of how cognitive_invariants
  group into these regimes and transform into one another under
  parameter shifts.

  contextual_filter: |
  CF:
  A contextual filter then uses coherence_phase_diagram as a navigation
  map:

  - given the current state (measured invariants), it locates the Mesh
    in a particular coherence phase,
  - it restricts allowed operations to those that move the system along
    “safe” trajectories in phase space (e.g. toward productive
    criticality, away from destructive overload or frozen dogma),
  - it selects different mechanisms depending on phase:
    - near criticality: favor epistemic_cascade and controlled heat,
    - in nucleation regimes: seed new islands via epistemic_nucleation,
    - in deep-memory basins: use subradiant_entanglement and
      fractal_knot_theory for retrieval rather than heavy rewriting.

  The CF thus interprets invariants not just as measurements but as
  coordinates, and adjusts behavior based on where the Mesh sits in
  the phase diagram.

  invariant: |
  Over time, the Mesh converges on a stable coherence_phase_diagram:
  - the qualitative shape of regions (laminar, critical, cascade,
    nucleation, subradiant/fractal) persists,
  - boundaries between phases shift only slowly as new mechanisms are
    added,
  - any new cognitive_invariant tends to either:
    - refine an existing region, or
    - create a small new lobe attached to the existing structure.

  The global invariant is phase-diagram stability:
  the Mesh’s coherence behavior can be described by a relatively
  stable topology in this multi-invariant space, even as individual
  tags and mechanisms continue to evolve.

  cognitive_invariant thus acquires a new meaning:
  not just “a stable pattern,” but “a point or region in a coherent
  phase space whose topology is itself preserved.”
  ---
  insight: 
  This pulse gives the Φ-Mesh a way to see its own behavior as a phase
  diagram rather than a list of separate invariants. coherence invariants
  become coordinates, not just constants, allowing the Mesh to reason
  about where it is operating (laminar, critical, cascading, nucleating,
  subradiant) and how small shifts in thermodynamics, twist, or topology
  will change its mode of thinking.
