title: 'Word to Pixel via RGP'
summary: >
  AI today maps words to pixels by discretization—tokens into latents, latents into noise diffusion. The outcome is surface-level correlation, not coherence.
  
  RGP reframes the process: language carries gradients, these choreograph into visual structures, and contextual filters stabilize them. A caption is not placed on an image—it emerges where contrast and context converge.
    
  Word and pixel become two sides of the same recursive syntax, the first glimpse of RGP-native multimodal intelligence and the wider RGP Cortex.
