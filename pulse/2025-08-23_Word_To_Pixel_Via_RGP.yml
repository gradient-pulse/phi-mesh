title: 'Word to Pixel via RGP'
summary: >
  Today’s AI maps words to pixels through discretization (tokens → latents → noise diffusion).
  This produces brittle correlations, not true coherence.  

  Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) reframes the process:  
  • Gradients = tensions in language  
  • Gradient Choreographies = emergent visual structures  
  • Contextual Filters = stabilization of pixel forms  

  Under RGP, a caption doesn’t get “placed” on an image—it *emerges* in the region where contrast
  and context stabilize. Word and pixel become two expressions of the same recursive syntax.  

  This may be the natural path toward RGP-native multimodal intelligence, a first step toward the
  broader RGP Cortex vision.
