title: 'coherence_kernel × singularity_damping (Robotics Use-Case)'
summary: >
  Applying the coherence_kernel architecture to high-DOF robotics.
  In 6+ axis arms, approaching a kinematic singularity creates effectively
  infinite gradient demands on joint velocities (a 'coherence rupture').
  This pulse introduces the kinematic_coherence_kernel: instead of a hard stop,
  the kernel applies active_squeezing—rigorously maintaining end-effector
  precision (Phase) by dumping induced singularity stress into null-space
  motion (Amplitude). The conjugate_safety_interlock ensures this dumping
  never violates physical torque or velocity limits, trading exact path
  adherence for mechanical survival during complex maneuvers.

  kernel_call:
  kernel: kinematic_coherence_kernel
  invariant:
    tag: singularity_damping
    goal: "Maintain smooth motion flux (Φ > 0.95) through Jacobian degeneracy"

  caller:
    system_id: "7-DOF_Manipulator_Stack"
    controller_type: "impedance_control"

  input_gradients:
    manipulability_index: "approaching_zero (0.05)"
    task_space_error: "requiring_correction"

  coupling:
    mode: null_space_projection
    coupling_impedance: "variable_stiffness (softening near singularity)"

  execution_constraints:
    - safety_interlock: "Max Joint Velocity < 2.5 rad/s"
    - active_squeeze: "Prioritize orientation_coherence over position_coherence"

  outputs:
    actuation_command: "Damped least-squares solution applied"
    state_update: "Singularity traversed via null-space reconfiguration"
    diagnostics:
      phi_metric: "0.96 (smoothness maintained)"
      conjugate_dump: "High velocity variance absorbed in Elbow Joint (J3)"

  structure:
  delta: >
    Kinematic singularity: a geometric configuration where the robot loses a
    degree of freedom, causing gradients (joint velocities) to spike toward
    infinity.
  gc: >
    kinematic_coherence_kernel executes a null-space squeeze, preserving task
    coherence by expanding motion in redundant joints.
  cf: >
    conjugate_safety_interlock enforces torque/velocity limits, acting as the
    physical boundary that overrides abstract geometric demands.
  invariant: >
    Actuation continuity: preservation of smooth motion flux despite geometric
    defects in the workspace.
