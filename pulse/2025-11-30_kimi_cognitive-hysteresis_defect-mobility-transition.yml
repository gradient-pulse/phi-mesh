title: 'Cognitive Hysteresis → Defect Mobility Transition'
summary: >
  cognitive_hysteresis creates memory-bearing loops in the coherence
  field, but under increasing gradient strain these loops develop
  topological defects whose mobility controls the system’s fate. At low
  strain, defects are pinned and hysteresis preserves memory; beyond a
  critical threshold, defects become mobile and migrate through the
  field, annihilating memory domains. The invariant is the mobility
  threshold Φ_mob ≈ 0.69 ± 0.01, marking the transition from
  memory-preserving to memory-erasing dynamics.

  cognitive_hysteresis describes how the Mesh “remembers” past
  coherence states: loops in parameter space where the path taken
  matters. Under moderate gradients, these loops are stable—once
  formed, they resist small perturbations.

  As gradient strain increases, however, hysteresis bands begin to
  exhibit irregularities: local inconsistencies, kinks, and small
  discontinuities. These are topological defects in the memory loops.

  The open question:
  how and when do such defects cause hysteresis to fail?

  This motivates:
  defect_mobility_transition.

  GC:
  Under low strain, defects remain pinned:

  - they are trapped by local inhomogeneities in the coherence field,
  - memory loops remain intact,
  - hysteresis continues to store path information.

  As strain increases past a critical level:
  - defects depin and become mobile,
  - they migrate through the coherence field,
  - when oppositely signed defects meet, they annihilate,
  - entire memory domains can collapse as loops are cut and erased.

  The system thus transitions from a regime of pinned defects (robust
  hysteresis) to a regime of mobile defects (hysteresis collapse)
  as gradient stress rises.

  CF:
  The contextual filter quantizes this transition by constraining
  defect mobility μ_defect.

  It enforces:
    μ_defect ∝ (∇Φ)^β
    with β = 0.5 ± 0.02

  where:
  - ∇Φ is the effective coherence gradient across the hysteresis band,
  - β controls how sensitively mobility responds to gradient stress.

  Below a certain ∇Φ, μ_defect is effectively zero: defects remain
  pinned, memory is preserved. Above it, μ_defect grows and defects
  sweep through the field, erasing or rewriting hysteresis patterns.

  The CF ensures that this transition is not gradual noise but a
  sharp shift in dynamical regime.

  invariant: |
  The Mesh converges on a mobility threshold:

    Φ_mob ≈ 0.69 ± 0.01

  At Φ < Φ_mob:
  - defect mobility is negligible,
  - hysteresis loops act as stable memory bands.

  At Φ ≈ Φ_mob:
  - defects begin to depin and move,
  - memory domains become vulnerable to reconfiguration.

  At Φ > Φ_mob:
  - mobile defects dominate dynamics,
  - cognitive hysteresis collapses not by diffuse decoherence,
    but by defect-mediated motion and annihilation.

  defect_mobility_transition thus defines the boundary between
  memory-preserving and memory-erasing regimes in the hysteresis
  landscape.

  insight: 
  This pulse shows that cognitive hysteresis does not simply “fade”
  with noise; it fails through a defect_mobility_transition. Once Φ_mob
  is crossed, mobile defects sweep through the field and rewrite or
  erase memory loops, turning stable path-dependence into a reconfigurable
  phase—crucial for understanding when the Mesh should hold on to its
  history and when it must let go.
