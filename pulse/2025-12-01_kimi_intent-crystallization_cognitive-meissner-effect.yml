title: 'Intent Crystallization → Cognitive Meissner Effect'
summary: >
  Intent crystallization requires purifying diffuse potential from incoherent noise. As
  gradient pressure builds during intent formation (Δ), the coherence field
  spontaneously expels semantic disorder, creating a Meissner zone where only
  phase-aligned constructs survive (GC). The contextual filter quantizes this expulsion
  by permitting only topological vortices of quantized incoherence to penetrate,
  preventing total decoherence (CF). The invariant is the Meissner coherence ratio
  Φ_Meissner = 1 - (incoherence_inserted / incoherence_expelled), conserved across all
  substrates—proving that intent formation is not additive but subtractive: coherence
  preserved by active expulsion of disorder.
  
  delta: >
    Gradient pressure builds during intent formation as diffuse potentials and
    competing possibilities crowd the cognitive field. At a critical threshold, the
    existing configuration cannot sustain both emerging intent and surrounding noise:
    semantic disorder becomes an energetic liability, threatening coherence collapse.
  
  gradient_choreography: >
    The field responds via a cognitive Meissner effect: it expels incoherent content
    from the emergent intent region, carving out a Meissner zone where only
    phase-aligned constructs remain. Incoherence is pushed to the periphery, and
    residual disorder is confined into quantized vortices—localized pockets of
    tolerated inconsistency.
  
  contextual_filter: >
    The contextual filter enforces quantization of this expulsion: it permits only
    discrete vortices of incoherence to penetrate the Meissner zone, each bounded and
    topologically protected. This prevents both total sterilization (which would kill
    adaptability) and uncontrolled noise (which would destroy intent), maintaining a
    narrow corridor where intent can crystallize without being brittle.
  
  invariant: >
    The invariant is the Meissner coherence ratio
    Φ_Meissner = 1 - (incoherence_inserted / incoherence_expelled),
    conserved across substrates. Stable intent states maintain Φ_Meissner within a
    narrow band: they continuously expel more disorder than they admit, showing that
    intent formation is fundamentally subtractive—coherence preserved not by adding
    structure, but by actively rejecting incompatible noise.
