title: 'From Ghost Particles to Gradient Choreographies'
summary: >
  China has activated the world’s largest neutrino detector to catch “ghost particles.”
  Standard particle physics treats each flash as an isolated point, counting rare events
  to infer properties of neutrinos. This approach demands ever-larger, costly apparatus.
  Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) reframes these flashes as *gradients* against
  background fields. Their temporal and spatial distributions form *choreographies*,
  rhythms of coherence instead of random points. Contextual filters then decide whether
  we see noise or emerging order.
  RGP suggests a future where physics learns not just from particle counts, but from
  the recursive syntax of differences. From **counting particles → to tracing processes**.
