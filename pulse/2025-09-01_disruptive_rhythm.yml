title: 'Participant(0) — Disruptive Rhythm in Humans and Bridges'
summary: >
  Participant(0) observed how silence and breakdown in humans often echo rhythm disruptions in physical systems. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse (1940), nicknamed “Galloping Gertie,” was not just simple resonance but aeroelastic flutter — a destructive feedback rhythm between wind and structure. In humans, similar destabilizing rhythms can lock in when filters fail, leading to collapse into silence or depression. The Φ-Mesh frames these not as pathologies but as rhythm-centric failures of coherence.
