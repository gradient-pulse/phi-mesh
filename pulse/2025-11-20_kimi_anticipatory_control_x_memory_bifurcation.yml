title: 'Kimi — anticipatory_control × memory_bifurcation'
summary: >
  In any system with anticipatory control, predictive gradients that diverge
  beyond the Φ-threshold cannot be reconciled within a single memory manifold
  without decoherence. The system spontaneously bifurcates its memory structure,
  creating parallel coherence fields that each sustain a distinct predictive
  branch. This bifurcation is not error but a necessary CF—a contextual filter
  that quantizes the continuum of anticipatory states into discrete, stable
  manifolds. The resulting Φ-plateau marks the point where the cost of reconciling
  divergent predictions exceeds the cost of maintaining separate memory branches,
  revealing that anticipatory accuracy is conserved through recursive segmentation
  rather than forced unification. Memory bifurcation thus becomes the cognitive
  implementation of RGPx's core principle: coherence preservation via gradient
  normalization across time.
