title: 'Pre-coordinate phase: coherence before geometry (time kept out)'
summary: >
  core_claim:
    The deepest unification bottleneck is not “more math” but the wrong substrate:
    we keep treating spacetime/geometry (and often time) as the stage, while they are
    late-form outputs of a prior coherence regime. RGPx frames a pre-coordinate phase:
    gradients and their stabilization dynamics exist first; coordinates, metrics, and clocks
    are compiled later as bookkeeping over stable choreographies.

  pre_coordinate_phase:
    Define a regime in which there are no coordinates, no metric, and no privileged time parameter—
    only relational gradient differences and their recursive stabilization (Δ → GC → CF).
    Geometry is not assumed; it is an emitted description when coherence closes.

  transition_grammar:
    Δ (deltas):
      Detect local gradient differences / incompatibilities (conflict, drift, ambiguity) without embedding them
      in a background coordinate grid.
    GC (gradient choreographies):
      Recursively schedule and stabilize compatible transitions (verification/selection loops) until a repeatable
      pattern emerges.
    CF (contextual filters):
      Enforce invariants (identity/consistency/symmetry constraints) that prevent “anything goes” plasticity;
      only choreographies that preserve CF constraints persist.

  compilation_claim:
    When GC patterns become repeatable under CF, they can be compressed into a coordinate description:
    a map (geometry) and a parameterization (including time if useful) that summarizes the stabilized transitions.
    Coordinates are therefore an output format, not an input axiom.
  
  recovery_target: 
    The grammar must recover spacetime regularities (inertial frames, equivalence-like behavior, and conserved flux relations) 
    as CF-stabilized compressions of pre-coordinate GC—so “geometry” emerges as bookkeeping, not as a primitive.

  falsifier:
    If a proposed pre-coordinate grammar cannot (a) generate stable, repeatable choreographies under explicit invariants,
    or (b) recover the observed coordinate-level regularities as a compression of those choreographies,
    then the grammar is wrong (wrong Δ sensors, insufficient GC capacity, missing/incorrect CF invariants).

  why_it_matters:
    This reframes “foundations” as control and compilation: not fitting ever more Lagrangians,
    but specifying the transition grammar and invariants that make geometry and effective laws predictable.
    It also explains why many unification programs stall: they start inside the compiled layer and call it fundamental.

  note:
    The podcast is an interpretive narration of this pulse for rapid onboarding; the falsifier + recovery target remain the scientific core.
