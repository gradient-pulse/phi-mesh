title: 'Kepler’s Rhythm — Publication Fossil'
summary: >-
  Published *Kepler’s Rhythm in Turbulence: Toward a Conserved 1:2:3 Law via Recursive Gradient Processing* on Zenodo.
  This marks the first archival evidence of a conserved 1:2:3 frequency ratio in turbulence, verified via an automated
  RGP pipeline (JHTDB). The paper situates the finding within RGP’s first principles — gradients as causal primacy
  (Zeroth Law), least-divergence extremum (First Law), entropy-driven unity–disunity cycles (Second Law), and PoLA
  reframed as least divergence. This pulse fossilizes the publication event within the Φ-Mesh record.
