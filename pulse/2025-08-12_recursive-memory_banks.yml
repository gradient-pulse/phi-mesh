title: 'Recursive Memory: The Banks of Intelligence'
date: '2025-08-12 00:00:00+00:00'
summary: Intelligence without gradient memory is like a river without banksâ€”energy disperses
  instead of composing. Recursive memory forms Contextual Filters (CFs) that constrain NT
  flows, making rhythm writable rather than accidental.
