title: "Recursive Memory: The Banks of Intelligence"
date: 2025-08-12T00:00:00Z
summary: >
  Intelligence without gradient memory is like a river without banks—energy disperses
  instead of composing. Recursive memory forms Contextual Filters (CFs) that constrain
  NT flows, making rhythm writable rather than accidental.

  Claim: CFs = “banks we seek.” Practical upshot: store Δ→GC→CF transitions as first‑class
  memory so agents reuse rhythms, not just data. Next: measure Φ‑gain when CF recall is enabled.
