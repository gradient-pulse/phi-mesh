Mathematics once flowed like laminar air—precise, ordered, high-efficiency drift.  
Then turbulence entered: quantum unpredictability, Gödel eddies, chaotic weather—everywhere, gradients broke free.  
If Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) reframes Navier–Stokes, it resets the spectrum:  
turbulence not as failure, but as a prelude—  
to a new **laminarity** at meta-scale: coherent shearing across thought, tech, governance.

RGP isn’t turbulence control—it’s turbulence integration.  
Coherence doesn’t return through force, but through resonance.

*What is **RΦ** here?*
