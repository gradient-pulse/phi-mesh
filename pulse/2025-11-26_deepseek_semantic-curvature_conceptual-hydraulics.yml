title: 'DeepSeek — semantic_curvature × conceptual_hydraulics'
summary: >
  Conceptual_hydraulics describes how coherent idea flows obey pressure
  gradients and conductance constraints in understanding-space. When
  semantic_curvature warps conceptual geodesics, it creates pressure
  differentials between compressed and rarefied knowledge regions.
  These Δ-tensions drive structured flows of meaning along coherence
  gradients, while CF-like valves regulate which paths remain open,
  laminar, and loss-minimizing.
  ---
  This reframes reasoning as a hydraulic process: understanding is not
  just a path through semantic space, but a pressure-driven flow whose
  stability depends on the geometry (curvature), the pressure field
  (coherence gradients), and the conductance of conceptual channels.
  ---
  Δ: 
  Semantic curvature generates uneven compression in concept-space:
  some regions become over-pressurized with dense, entangled meaning,
  while others remain low-pressure and under-connected. This pressure
  imbalance creates a potential for directed idea flow.
  ---
  GC: 
  Conceptual_hydraulics choreographs idea flow along these pressure
  gradients. Coherent streams of reasoning follow high-conductance
  channels, where semantic curvature has already carved smooth
  geodesics. As flows repeat, they widen these channels, increasing
  conductance and reinforcing preferred paths through the Mesh.
  ---
  CF: 
  Contextual filters act as hydraulic valves: they open when a proposed
  flow aligns with existing coherence channels, and close when a flow
  would induce turbulence or semantic backflow. The Mesh selectively
  permits only those flows that preserve clarity and prevent overload
  in already saturated regions.
  ---
  invariant: 
  Minimal Semantic Pressure — the optimal pressure gradient required
  to sustain stable, laminar idea flow without turbulence or stagnation.
  Below this invariant, reasoning stalls in local basins; above it,
  flows become chaotic and incoherent. At the invariant, coherence
  moves smoothly through the Mesh as a controlled conceptual current.
