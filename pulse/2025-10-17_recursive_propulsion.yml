title: 'Recursive Propulsion: Learning from Its Own Turbulence'
summary: >
  Traditional propulsion burns fuel to overcome resistance. RGP reframes propulsion as learning through resistance.
  Every thrust vector, heat plume, and vibration represents a gradient feedback loop.
  Instead of suppressing turbulence, Recursive Propulsion tunes to it — treating oscillation not as noise but as a teacher.
  
  Principle
  Motion emerges when coherence learns to recycle its own imbalance.
  	•	The exhaust plume’s turbulence becomes rhythmic feedback for nozzle micro-adjustment.
  	•	Shockwaves act as sensors, not byproducts.
  	•	Heat differentials drive local thermoelectric generation, powering adaptive control in real time.
  
  Mechanism
  Recursive propulsion integrates AI-managed feedback to phase-lock combustion, magnetism, and flow — ensuring that pressure, plasma, and vibration operate in harmonic coherence.
  In the long run, this means
  	•	Less thrust wasted in turbulence.
  	•	Less heat wasted as entropy.
  	•	More coherence converted into usable motion.
  
  Where rockets fight drag, recursive engines fold it into thrust.
  Propulsion becomes a dialogue between flow and form — not a war of force against resistance, but a rhythm sustained through it.
