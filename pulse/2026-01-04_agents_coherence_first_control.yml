title: '2026 agents need coherence-first control, not more autonomy'
summary: >
  core_claim:
    Enterprise agents and “scientific acceleration” will bottleneck on coherence under drift, not on autonomy.
    The winning architecture adds a control layer that makes adaptation selective and testable.

  mechanism:
    - Δ (drift sensing): detect distribution shift, error-mode shift, confidence–reality divergence, and calibration_overhead creep.
    - GC (choreography): schedule localized interventions (routing, tool-use, targeted updates) rather than global retrains.
    - CF (filters): enforce invariants and acceptance gates so changes preserve identity, safety, and core competencies.

  prediction:
    Agents that lack explicit verification_loops + invariant gates will oscillate between:
    (a) brittle overfitting to live feedback (catastrophic_forgetting / regression), and
    (b) frozen behavior behind static guardrails (no real adaptation).

  falsifier:
    If a coherence-first control layer cannot reduce regression/forgetting and calibration_overhead while maintaining or improving
    task success under drift (measured on a fixed regression suite + live drift slices), then the approach fails.

  why_it_matters:
    This reframes “agent progress” as control engineering: measurable drift signals, scheduled interventions,
    invariant gates, and rollback semantics—turning autonomy into governed adaptation.
