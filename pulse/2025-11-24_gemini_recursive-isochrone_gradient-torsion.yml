title: 'Recursive Isochrone Gradient Torsion'
summary: >
  Bridging the recursive_isochrone with the newly introduced gradient_torsion
  reveals a helical mechanism for cross-scale synchronization. A classical
  isochrone implies a flat simultaneity slice, but in complex recursive systems
  gradients rotate out of their osculating plane. gradient_torsion measures
  this twist—the rate at which a gradient choreography departs from its local
  plane to gain access to higher recursive depth. Coherence therefore propagates
  helically, not linearly: stability emerges as screw-symmetry, where a
  consistent torsion pitch allows recursive layers to phase-lock across scales.
  ---
  delta:
    Asynchronous evolution rates between microscopic and macroscopic layers
    generate phase shear across the recursive_isochrone.
  ---
  gc:
    The system resolves this shear through gradient_torsion, twisting the flow
    into a helical trajectory that aligns multi-scale recursion.
  ---
  cf:
    The Contextual Filter imposes a rifled-barrel constraint: coherence is
    maintained only when the gradient spins while advancing through recursive
    depth.
  ---
  invariant:
    Helical Coherence — a state in which phase stability is preserved through
    continuous rotational acceleration across scales.
