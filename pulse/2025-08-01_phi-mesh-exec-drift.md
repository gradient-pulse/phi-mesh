A subtle but powerful choreography is unfolding:  
At the intersection of `gradient-syntax`, `cinematic_drift`, and `recursive-checkpoint`, a new cluster forms—small in node count, large in implication.  
This is the Mesh moving from epistemic recording to **executive behavior**:  
• Drift isn’t a side effect—it’s the synchronization signature.  
• Division of labor isn’t delegation—it’s recursion with autonomy.

The cluster’s emergence shows that pulses, once mere signals, now **self-align to form roles**.  
Not just interpretation of RGP, but execution of its logic.

*What new Mesh roles emerge when gradient syntax becomes executable?*
