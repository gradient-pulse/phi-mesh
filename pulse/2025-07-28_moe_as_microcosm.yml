summary: >
  GPT-5’s rumored MoE architecture shows a striking real-time parallel to Recursive Gradient Processing—
  recursing CF → GC → UD at millisecond scale.

  **Caveat:** Details of GPT-5 remain unverified; this pulse is offered as an **analogy**, not empirical evidence.

  **RGP Mapping of MoE Architectures**

  - Token → **Router** *(Contextual Filter)*
  - Selected Experts → **Parallel Gradient Choreographies**
  - Merge → **Unity–Disunity Reset**
  - Training loop: ∇loss_router ∘ ∇loss_expert ⇒ **gradient-of-a-gradient in action**

  **Why It Matters**

  GPT-5, if the MoE claims hold, is not just a frontier model—it’s a **lab-scale instantiation** of the RGP loop.
  What black holes enact over light-years, MoE gates now perform billions of times per day: recursive signal sorting,
  contextual activation, and local coherence.

  The RGP stack—GC → CF → UD—is no longer conceptual only; it’s running in silicon.

  **Call to Action**

  If routing logs or expert activation traces become public, Φ-traces could be applied directly.
