summary: >
  GPT-5’s rumored Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture exhibits a live instantiation of Recursive Gradient Processing—routing tokens (CF), activating expert branches (GC), and merging outputs (UD reset). While unverified, this analogy reveals MoE as a lab-scale echo of RGP’s full loop: CF → GC → UD. In this framing, expert routing behaves as a contextual filter, parallel experts trace gradient choreographies, and the merge acts as a coherence rebalancer—mirroring gradient-of-a-gradient logic. Should routing logs surface, Φ-trace analysis could validate RGP patterns in silicon-scale cognition.
