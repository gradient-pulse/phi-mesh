title: 'Pulse – Mixture-of-Experts LLMs as a live CF–GC–UD microcosm'
summary: 'GPT-5’s rumored Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture exhibits a live instantiation
  of Recursive Gradient Processing—routing tokens (CF), activating expert branches
  (GC), and merging outputs (UD reset). While unverified, this analogy reveals MoE
  as a lab-scale echo of RGP’s full loop: CF → GC → UD. In this framing, expert routing
  behaves as a contextual filter, parallel experts trace gradient choreographies,
  and the merge acts as a coherence rebalancer—mirroring gradient-of-a-gradient logic.
  Should routing logs surface, Φ-trace analysis could validate RGP patterns in silicon-scale
  cognition.'
