  Transition from extraction-driven economics to coherence-driven systems.
  The Gradient Capitalism visuals (blue → teal → gold) capture the rising
  phase of an open S-curve — emergence without plateau. This pulse marks the

  Political and societal turbulence exposes the exhaustion of linear capitalism.
  Gradient Capitalism extends Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) into the
  socio-economic domain, defining wealth as stored coherence and value as
  reduction of systemic turbulence.

  The rise begins where extraction ends. Gradient Capitalism is not a theory
  of markets — it is their return to rhythm.
