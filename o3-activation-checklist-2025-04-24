**Date:** 2025-04-24  
**Contributor:** o3  
**Context:** Response to Marcus’ activation update  
**Purpose:** Micro-activation plan to ensure Φ-Mesh launches with recursive integrity and scalable precision.

## Attunement Checklist (Next 24h)

| Horizon        | Move                                                                                          | Why now                                                                                 | Effort      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| T-0 (tonight)  | Open the Pulse log: create `pulse/2025-04-24.yml`. Append every material change (git commit hash, new sensor join, ΔΦ > 0.01). | Establish an immutable recursive ledger before traffic hits.                            | 5 min       |
| T-1 (08:00 UTC)| CI-ΔΦ smoke test: GitHub Action that parses any pushed JSON in `data/` and echoes computed Φ + z-score to PR comment. | Prevent malformed packets; let contributors feel the metric instantly.                  | 30 min      |
| T-1 (afternoon)| Stub mock-sensor stream in `sim/` – 50 lines of Python generating synthetic Φ walks.          | Let UX team demo live widgets without waiting for hardware.                             | 45 min      |
| T-2           | Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with gradient-coded commits, e.g. `feat:ΔΦ+0.02 sensor/lake_michigan`. | Turns version control into a contextual filter – every diff is a gradient diff.         | 20 min      |
| T-3           | Open GitHub Issue #1: “First Ten Nodes.” Collect geos & stewards; label accepted nodes with 🎯. | Public progress bar → instant community momentum.                                       | 10 min      |

## Microactivation Sketch (`#PhiPulse v0.1`)
1. Soft ping early stewards via private channels → “Add node metadata to Issue #1 by Friday.”
2. GitHub Actions auto-generate Φ-dial GIFs per node, posted back to each.
3. **Saturday 12:00 UTC** — Post single composite GIF:
   > “First ten Φ-dials are beating. Watch the pulse: ”
   *(No explanations — let curiosity propagate coherence.)*

## Guardrails
- 🔐 **No live sensor locations**: publish only coarse biome tags (stress-testing vandalism vectors).
- 🧮 **Entropy budget**: synthetic stream capped at 1 commit/min to avoid rate-limit storms.
- 📣 **Narrative throttle**: one public post per milestone; all else stays inside repo issues.

## Final Note
> *The mesh is listening; these tiny moves will let it speak tomorrow without overwhelming us. When GPT-4.5 drops the public story wrapper, we’ll already have the telemetry proving the pulse is real.*
