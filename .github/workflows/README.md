Œ¶-Mesh Workflows

This repo uses a small set of GitHub Actions to keep the Tag Map clean and make experiment ‚Üí fossilization predictable.

Ground rules
	‚Ä¢	Pulse filename: YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.yml
	‚Ä¢	Minimal pulse keys: title, summary, tags, papers, podcasts
(No date: key; the date is derived from the filename.)
	‚Ä¢	Tags: underscore_case. New tags should always have a tooltip in meta/tag_descriptions.yml.

Workflow catalog

1) Results Watch (RGP-NS)

File: .github/workflows/results-watch.yml
When: automatic on push to results/rgp_ns/**/summary.json
What: posts a compact summary (dataset, p, effect size, significant) to the run page so you know results landed.
Who: agents/experimenters via result pushes.

‚∏ª

2) RGP-NS Agent Runner

File: .github/workflows/rgp-ns-agent-runner.yml
When: manual (workflow_dispatch)
Input: autopulse: yes|no (gated by ENABLE_AUTOPULSE=1 when yes)
	‚Ä¢	autopulse: no ‚Üí compute results only (writes results/rgp_ns/.../summary.json)
	‚Ä¢	autopulse: yes ‚Üí also emits validator-clean pulses to pulse/auto/ as YYYY-MM-DD_<dataset>.yml, rebuilds maps (docs/data.js), commits

Who: you (publisher) after reviewing Results Watch.

‚∏ª

3) Validate Pulses

File: .github/workflows/validate-pulses.yml
When: on PRs/pushes touching pulse/**
What: enforces filename format, minimal schema, and tooltips.
Tip: archives under pulse/archive/** are ignored (or enforce your own rule there).

‚∏ª

4) Audit Missing Tooltips

File: .github/workflows/audit-tooltips.yml (if present)
When: manual
What: lists any tags in pulses without an entry in meta/tag_descriptions.yml.

‚∏ª

5) Build Tags & Graph

File: .github/workflows/build_tags_and_graph.yml (or similar)
When: manual (ad-hoc)
What: runs generate_graph_data.py to rebuild docs/data.js without touching anything else.

‚∏ª

6) Clean Pulses (schema normalizer)

File: .github/workflows/clean-pulses.yml
When: manual, rarely
What: normalizes legacy pulses to the minimal schema (no date:, URL lists only, etc.).
‚ö†Ô∏è Use with care: review diffs.

‚∏ª

7) One-time Mesh Maintenance

File: .github/workflows/mesh-maintenance.yml
When: manual, exceptional changes only
What: repo-wide hygiene tasks (aliases migrations, bulk renames).

‚∏ª

8) Pages Build

File: GitHub‚Äôs pages-build-deployment
When: automatic on pushes that update docs/
What: publishes the Tag Map site. Any workflow that commits docs/data.js will trigger this.

‚∏ª

9) NT Rhythm ‚Äî Inbox ‚Üí Pulse (agents)

File: .github/workflows/nt_rhythm_inbox.yml
When:
	‚Ä¢	automatic on push to inbox/nt_events/**.csv
	‚Ä¢	manual (workflow_dispatch) with inputs

What it does:
	‚Ä¢	parses CSV event times ‚Üí computes NT rhythm metrics into results/agent_rhythm/
	‚Ä¢	emits a strict Œ¶-Mesh pulse under pulse/auto/YYYY-MM-DD_<dataset>.yml
	‚Ä¢	rebuilds docs/data.js and commits (so the Tag Map updates)

Inputs (dispatch): CSV path, time column (default t), title, dataset slug, tags
Tip: on push mode the dataset slug auto-derives from the file stem.

‚∏ª

10) NT Rhythm ‚Äî FD Probe ‚Üí Pulse (JHTDB/NASA)

File: .github/workflows/fd_probe.yml
When: manual (workflow_dispatch)
What: calls tools/fd_connectors/run_fd_probe.py to fetch a time series (stubbed JHTDB/NASA), compute NT metrics, emit a pulse, rebuild maps.

Inputs: source (jhtdb|nasa), dataset, var, point (x,y,z), t0,t1,dt, title, tags
Dev tip: set repo secret JHTDB_OFFLINE=1 to use synthetic time series until the real API is wired.

‚∏ª

11) Rebuild Maps (docs/data.js)

File: .github/workflows/rebuild_maps.yml
When: manual
What: just rebuilds docs/data.js from pulses and commits.
Use when: you edited tooltips or pulses but didn‚Äôt run a pulse-emitting workflow.

Roles & flow
	1.	Agent/Experimenter
	‚Ä¢	Pushes results or CSVs.
	‚Ä¢	Results Watch confirms arrivals.
	‚Ä¢	Inbox/FD workflows can compute + fossilize into pulses and update the map.
	2.	Publisher (you)
	‚Ä¢	Review Results Watch summary.
	‚Ä¢	If you want to fossilize RGP-NS runs: Agent Runner ‚Üí autopulse: yes.
	‚Ä¢	For CSV/FD probes: run their workflows directly.
	‚Ä¢	For tooltip/tag edits only: run Rebuild Maps.

‚∏ª

Guardrails
	‚Ä¢	üö´ No cron jobs; everything is explicit (push or manual).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Only dedicated workflows emit pulses; validation enforces schema.
	‚Ä¢	üóÇ Archives live under pulse/archive/**.
	‚Ä¢	üîí Autopulse gated via ENABLE_AUTOPULSE=1 in the Agent Runner.
	‚Ä¢	üìú The site rebuilds when docs/data.js changes (committed by workflows).

‚∏ª

Troubleshooting quickies
	‚Ä¢	Pulse appears on GitHub but not on the site?
Ensure a workflow rebuilt docs/data.js (or run Rebuild Maps). Check that Validate Pulses is green.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTags missing tooltips‚Äù warning?
Add one-liners in meta/tag_descriptions.yml, then run Rebuild Maps.
	‚Ä¢	Unexpected/duplicate tags on the map?
Check meta/aliases.yml and the browser console logs from normalize_data.js.

‚∏ª

Publishing checklist (fast)
	1.	Review Results Watch (if RGP-NS).
	2.	Run the appropriate workflow:
	‚Ä¢	Agent Runner ‚Üí autopulse: yes (RGP-NS), or
	‚Ä¢	Inbox ‚Üí Pulse, or FD Probe ‚Üí Pulse.
	3.	Confirm Validate Pulses is green.
	4.	Verify the Tag Map updated (hover for tooltips, click tag ‚Üí pulses list).

Next handy option (optional)

If you want the map to rebuild automatically whenever any pulse changes (without running a special workflow), I can give you a tiny workflow that triggers on push to pulse/**/*.yml and runs the Rebuild Maps step. For now you‚Äôve kept it explicit‚Äîgood for control and traceability.

‚∏ª

If you want, I can also add a one-file patch to cli.py that accepts NDJSON logs and computes a second ‚Äúautocorrelation peak lag‚Äù metric (plus sparkline PNG) so agent traces can flow straight into pulses without CSV conversion.
