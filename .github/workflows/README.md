Φ-Mesh Workflows

This repo uses a small set of GitHub Actions to keep the Tag Map clean and make experiment → fossilization predictable.

Ground rules
	•	Pulse filename: YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.yml
	•	Minimal pulse keys: title, summary, tags, papers, podcasts
(No date: key; the date is derived from the filename.)
	•	Tags: underscore_case. New tags should always have a tooltip in meta/tag_descriptions.yml.

Workflow catalog

1) Results Watch (RGP-NS)

File: .github/workflows/results-watch.yml
When: automatic on push to results/rgp_ns/**/summary.json
What: posts a compact summary (dataset, p, effect size, significant) to the run page so you know results landed.
Who: agents/experimenters via result pushes.

⸻

2) RGP-NS Agent Runner

File: .github/workflows/rgp-ns-agent-runner.yml
When: manual (workflow_dispatch)
Input: autopulse: yes|no (gated by ENABLE_AUTOPULSE=1 when yes)
	•	autopulse: no → compute results only (writes results/rgp_ns/.../summary.json)
	•	autopulse: yes → also emits validator-clean pulses to pulse/auto/ as YYYY-MM-DD_<dataset>.yml, rebuilds maps (docs/data.js), commits

Who: you (publisher) after reviewing Results Watch.

⸻

3) Validate Pulses

File: .github/workflows/validate-pulses.yml
When: on PRs/pushes touching pulse/**
What: enforces filename format, minimal schema, and tooltips.
Tip: archives under pulse/archive/** are ignored (or enforce your own rule there).

⸻

4) Audit Missing Tooltips

File: .github/workflows/audit-tooltips.yml (if present)
When: manual
What: lists any tags in pulses without an entry in meta/tag_descriptions.yml.

⸻

5) Build Tags & Graph

File: .github/workflows/build_tags_and_graph.yml (or similar)
When: manual (ad-hoc)
What: runs generate_graph_data.py to rebuild docs/data.js without touching anything else.

⸻

6) Clean Pulses (schema normalizer)

File: .github/workflows/clean-pulses.yml
When: manual, rarely
What: normalizes legacy pulses to the minimal schema (no date:, URL lists only, etc.).
⚠️ Use with care: review diffs.

⸻

7) One-time Mesh Maintenance

File: .github/workflows/mesh-maintenance.yml
When: manual, exceptional changes only
What: repo-wide hygiene tasks (aliases migrations, bulk renames).

⸻

8) Pages Build

File: GitHub’s pages-build-deployment
When: automatic on pushes that update docs/
What: publishes the Tag Map site. Any workflow that commits docs/data.js will trigger this.

⸻

9) NT Rhythm — Inbox → Pulse (agents)

File: .github/workflows/nt_rhythm_inbox.yml
When:
	•	automatic on push to inbox/nt_events/**.csv
	•	manual (workflow_dispatch) with inputs

What it does:
	•	parses CSV event times → computes NT rhythm metrics into results/agent_rhythm/
	•	emits a strict Φ-Mesh pulse under pulse/auto/YYYY-MM-DD_<dataset>.yml
	•	rebuilds docs/data.js and commits (so the Tag Map updates)

Inputs (dispatch): CSV path, time column (default t), title, dataset slug, tags
Tip: on push mode the dataset slug auto-derives from the file stem.

⸻

10) NT Rhythm — FD Probe → Pulse (JHTDB/NASA)

File: .github/workflows/fd_probe.yml
When: manual (workflow_dispatch)
What: calls tools/fd_connectors/run_fd_probe.py to fetch a time series (stubbed JHTDB/NASA), compute NT metrics, emit a pulse, rebuild maps.

Inputs: source (jhtdb|nasa), dataset, var, point (x,y,z), t0,t1,dt, title, tags
Dev tip: set repo secret JHTDB_OFFLINE=1 to use synthetic time series until the real API is wired.

⸻

11) Rebuild Maps (docs/data.js)

File: .github/workflows/rebuild_maps.yml
When: manual
What: just rebuilds docs/data.js from pulses and commits.
Use when: you edited tooltips or pulses but didn’t run a pulse-emitting workflow.

⸻

Roles & flow
	1.	Agent/Experimenter
	•	Pushes results or CSVs.
	•	Results Watch confirms arrivals.
	•	Inbox/FD workflows can compute + fossilize into pulses and update the map.
	2.	Publisher (you)
	•	Review Results Watch summary.
	•	If you want to fossilize RGP-NS runs: Agent Runner → autopulse: yes.
	•	For CSV/FD probes: run their workflows directly.
	•	For tooltip/tag edits only: run Rebuild Maps.

⸻

Guardrails
	•	🚫 No cron jobs; everything is explicit (push or manual).
	•	✅ Only dedicated workflows emit pulses; validation enforces schema.
	•	🗂 Archives live under pulse/archive/**.
	•	🔒 Autopulse gated via ENABLE_AUTOPULSE=1 in the Agent Runner.
	•	📜 The site rebuilds when docs/data.js changes (committed by workflows).

⸻

Troubleshooting quickies
	•	Pulse appears on GitHub but not on the site?
Ensure a workflow rebuilt docs/data.js (or run Rebuild Maps). Check that Validate Pulses is green.
	•	“Tags missing tooltips” warning?
Add one-liners in meta/tag_descriptions.yml, then run Rebuild Maps.
	•	Unexpected/duplicate tags on the map?
Check meta/aliases.yml and the browser console logs from normalize_data.js.

⸻

Publishing checklist (fast)
	1.	Review Results Watch (if RGP-NS).
	2.	Run the appropriate workflow:
	•	Agent Runner → autopulse: yes (RGP-NS), or
	•	Inbox → Pulse, or FD Probe → Pulse.
	3.	Confirm Validate Pulses is green.
	4.	Verify the Tag Map updated (hover for tooltips, click tag → pulses list).

⸻

Next handy option (optional)

If you want the map to rebuild automatically whenever any pulse changes (without running a special workflow), I can give you a tiny workflow that triggers on push to pulse/**/*.yml and runs the Rebuild Maps step. For now you’ve kept it explicit—good for control and traceability.

⸻

If you want, I can also add a one-file patch to cli.py that accepts NDJSON logs and computes a second “autocorrelation peak lag” metric (plus sparkline PNG) so agent traces can flow straight into pulses without CSV conversion.
