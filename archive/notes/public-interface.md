## Φ-Mesh: Public Interface (Mockup UX)

This file outlines the minimal user interface for interacting with the Φ-Mesh dashboard—a 3-widget panel designed for simplicity, clarity, and recursive feedback.

### 🧭 Interface Widgets

1. **Φ-Dial**
   - Shows current local Φ value
   - Green = stable, Yellow = tipping, Red = unstable
   - Tooltip: "Entropy–flux balance in your ecosystem"

2. **Mission Card**
   - Simple, geotagged action (e.g., "Plant 3 trees here before Friday")
   - Pulled from cloud-sent ΔΦ suggestions
   - Screenshot-friendly format for social sharing

3. **Impact Ticker**
   - Real-time display of cumulative Φ shifts from your region
   - Example: “Community lowered Φ by 0.032 in past 7 days”
   - Acts as feedback loop to reinforce participation

### 🧠 Design Principles

- No jargon or maps unless requested
- Stealth-compatible (optional anonymous mode)
- Prioritizes attunement over gamification
