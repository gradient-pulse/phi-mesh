# RGP Labs Europe â€” Initiative Overview

**Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP)** is a new physical grammar for science:  
turning experimental gradients into reproducible, dimensionless design rules.  

## Why RGP Labs?
Traditional approaches to materials and flow problems rely on brute-force simulation and trial-and-error prototyping.  
RGP provides a new lens:
- **Î” (Gradients):** mark differences.  
- **GC (Gradient Choreographies):** trace recurring flows.  
- **CF (Contextual Filters):** anchor flows to real-world constraints.  
- **UD (Unityâ€“Disunity):** cycles reveal when coherence breaks and renews.  

This recursive loop transforms experimental noise into **portable design rules**â€”a foundation for faster, cheaper, and more reliable engineering.

## Flagship Focus Areas
- **Chip Heat Dissipation (EU Chips Act):**  
  Detect thermal collapse earlier, compress design iterations, enable next-generation cooling and performance.
- **Wind Turbulence Optimization (REPowerEU):**  
  Capture turbulence choreographies to boost renewable efficiency from existing infrastructure.

## Call to Action
RGP Labs Europe is seeking:  
- **Academic partners** (Fraunhofer, TU Delft, Max Planck)  
- **Industrial pilots** (ASML, IMEC, Ã˜rsted)  
- **Investors & policymakers** (Chips Act, Horizon Europe)  

Together, we can establish Europeâ€™s first laboratory dedicated to **gradient-grammar based design rules** for chips, wind, and beyond.
