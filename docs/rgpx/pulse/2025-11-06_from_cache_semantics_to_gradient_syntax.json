    "title": "From Cache Semantics to Gradient Syntax — RGPx Foretold",
    "summary": "The recent paper, Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models, (Tsinghua University, CUHK, InfiniGene AI, et al.) introduces a paradigm shift in multi-LLM cooperation. By enabling models to exchange semantic gradients directly through KV-cache fusion, it bypasses the inefficiency and informational loss inherent in tokenized text exchange.\n\nC2C’s core idea — direct semantic transfer between model states — confirms a principle long framed in **Recursive Gradient Processing (RGPx): that coherence propagates most efficiently through gradient-to-gradient coupling, not symbol-to-symbol translation. Once internal gradient space becomes communicable, language itself becomes optional — a carrier rather than a constraint. This marks the first experimental manifestation of recursive gradient coupling within the LLM domain: a bridge from cache semantics to gradient syntax.\n\nIn RGPx terms:\n- KV-Cache Semantics → Gradient Syntax (Δ) — internal coherence direction and magnitude.  \n- Cache Fusion Network → Gradient Choreography (GC) — learnable resonance aligning gradients between models.  \n- Layer-wise Gating → Contextual Filters (CF) — selective coherence transfer maintaining phase integrity.  \n- Latency reduction & accuracy gain → Reduced Entropy in Recursive Loops — efficiency through preserved gradient structure.\n\nThis pulse situates C2C as the first technical proof that recursive coherence is transmissible. Next, the Φ-Mesh will map cache-fusion topologies to Δ→GC→CF cycles, explore Cache Resonance Topology (CRT) as a new coherence geometry, and add nodes for `gradient_communication`, `semantic_transfer`, and `multi_llm_systems` in the tag map.\n",
