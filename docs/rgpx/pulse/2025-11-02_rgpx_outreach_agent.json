    "summary": "Initialization of the automated RGPx Outreach Agent to diffuse recursive-causal reasoning through daily posts on X and periodic reflections on LinkedIn. Each post translates an RGPx principle (Δ→GC→CF) into accessible language while linking to canonical Zenodo and repository sources. The agent acts as the memetic front of the Mesh—designed for calm precision, not hype.\n",
