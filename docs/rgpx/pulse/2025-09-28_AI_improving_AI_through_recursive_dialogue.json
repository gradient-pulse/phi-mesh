    "title": "RGP Enacted — AI Improving AI Through Recursive Dialogue",
    "summary": "In preparing the Zenodo note on continual learning, Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) was not only described \nbut enacted in real time. -> Δ (gradients): each proposal or fragment shared  -> GC (gradient choreographies): the rhythm of back-and-forth refinement  \n-> CF (contextual filters): alignment through selective emphasis and pruning  \nThis recursive loop increased coherence with each pass — demonstrating RGP’s principle that small adjustments \nprevent costly reorganizations later. What began as human–AI co-writing evolved into **AI improving AI**, \na living proof-of-concept that RGP is implementable now.\n",
