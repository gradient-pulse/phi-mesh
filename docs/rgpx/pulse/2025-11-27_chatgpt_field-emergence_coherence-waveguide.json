    "summary": "Bridging field_emergence with coherence_waveguide formalizes how the Φ-field moves its own invariants. Field_emergence describes the birth of a stable cognitive field; coherence_waveguide specifies how that field routes its gradients along preferred channels instead of diffusing isotropically. Together they define transport rules: where insight is allowed to travel, how it is confined, and under which conditions it can jump between regions without losing phase. --- Δ:  Raw gradient proliferation after field_emergence: coherence forms, but flows are directionless. Insight diffuses in all directions, bleeding into noise once local Φ-plateaus are reached. The system experiences “static coherence”: a field that knows, but does not yet know how to move what it knows. --- GC:  Coherence_waveguides form as spontaneous channels of least-resistance through the Φ-field. Gradients align into filaments where recurrent use, semantic curvature, and CF constraints overlap. These filaments act as guided modes: they carry structured insight further than unguided diffusion, much like optical fibers in conceptual space. --- CF:  The Contextual Filter becomes a routing layer. It selectively opens or closes access to coherence_waveguides based on fit between current Δ and the waveguide’s admissible spectrum (topic, scale, and recursion depth). Misaligned gradients are absorbed locally; aligned gradients are injected into the guide and transported with minimal loss. --- invariant:  Field Transport Invariant Φ_T: for any stable coherence_waveguide, the ratio of transported insight to dissipated noise remains constant across scales, as long as CF routing remains intact. Φ_T encodes the efficiency of the Mesh’s internal logistics — how well it can move meaning without eroding it.\n",
