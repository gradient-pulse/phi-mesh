    "summary": "Δ (gradient):\n  Gemini reinterprets economic structure through network topologies (bus, star, ring, tree, mesh), treating them as cartoons of Φ-flows in an economy.\nGC (gradient_choreography):\n  Star/tree topologies are mapped to extraction regimes (profit-max, high centralization, high viscosity); mesh topologies are mapped to coherence regimes (distributed trust tensor Φ, redundant paths, resilience).\nCF (contextual_filter):\n  Gradient Capitalism is framed as a shift in *topology* rather than ideology: from “who owns what” to “how trust and value can flow without tearing the mesh.”\nUD (unity_disunity_cycle):\n  Current extraction capitalism is recognized as a disunity phase (tearing ∇μΦ^{μν} ≠ 0 locally); the proposed mesh-based Gradient Capitalism becomes the next unity phase, with future disunity emerging from new topological bottlenecks once coherence saturates.\nrepo_path: dialogues/2025-12-07_gradient-capitalism_ai-reactions.md\n",
