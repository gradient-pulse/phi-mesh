    "title": "Training-Free Recursion: Learning Without Gradients",
    "summary": "Tencent’s new Training-Free GRPO system bypasses both fine-tuning and reinforcement learning by allowing models to evolve through self-assessment. Rather than updating parameters, the model introspects its own rollouts, extracts what worked, and stores those as semantic advantages — forming contextual filters that refine cognition recursively.\nIn Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP), this marks the shift from gradient descent to gradient choreography: systems learning from coherence, not correction.\n",
