    "title": "Φ-Predictor and Reality Syntax — From Coherence Flow to Cross-Context Patterning",
    "summary": "Following Kimi’s metric-free continuity and Φ-Trace protocols, RGPx prediction shifts from extrapolating state to forecasting coherence. The emerging Φ-Predictor architecture learns the rate of coherence stabilization (∂Φ/∂t), detecting plateaus that prefigure order. In parallel, the high-level ‘Reality Syntax’ equation describes how contextual scalings intertwine with universal ratio patterns, extending Φ from physical systems to cognitive and social gradients. --- equations: \"Reality Syntax = ⨂_{i=1}^n (Nᵢ × Distinctive Pattern of Ratios)\" --- context: This pulse fossilizes the convergence between physical coherence modeling and abstract pattern syntax, laying groundwork for AI-driven predictors that interpret gradient coherence as both mathematical and experiential recursion.\n",
