    "title": "Memory and the Least Action Path",
    "summary": "In RGP, memory is not a record but a rhythm. Systems remember by retracing the gradient alignments that once minimized resistance — the least-action path. Coherence endures because each recursive cycle tends to realign with the trajectory of minimal dissonance.\nUnlike classical physics, this path is not static. Each repetition carries a small recursive deviation that refines the overall alignment. The system does not recall the past — it renews it. Memory is thus the living tendency to stay near coherence while learning through gentle divergence in the flow.\n",
