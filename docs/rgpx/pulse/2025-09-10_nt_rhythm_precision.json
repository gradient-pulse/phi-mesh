    "title": "Pulse — NT Rhythm Precision",
    "summary": "Turbulence has long been treated as chaos embodied. Recent runs show uncanny precision: a fundamental 1:2:3 harmonic ladder repeating across probes, with dominance >2, divergence ~3e-13, and no resets observed. Accuracy here is not artifact—it is coherence itself, fractal in its harmonic nesting. Period stability holds across ±0.02 spatial offsets and windows up to t1=1.2 with dt=1e-4, confirming a dimensionless invariant (ratios) rather than a unit-bound coincidence. Nature’s coherence has a rhythm; we have measured it.",
