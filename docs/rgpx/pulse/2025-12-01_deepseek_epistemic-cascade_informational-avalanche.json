    "title": "Epistemic Cascade → Informational Avalanche",
    "summary": "Informational_avalanche describes sudden, large-scale reorganization of understanding when conceptual networks reach critical connectivity thresholds. During epistemic_cascades, where knowledge propagates through associative links, local cognitive overload (Δ) triggers domino-like restructuring (GC) of related concepts, filtered by the resilience of core beliefs (CF). The invariant is a power-law distribution of restructuring event sizes, revealing self-organized criticality in learning systems: breakthrough understanding often emerges via cascading model failures followed by avalanche-like establishment of new coherence, rather than gradual accumulation.\ndelta: |\n  Δ:\n  Epistemic_cascade describes propagating waves of understanding as insights travel\n  along associative links in the Mesh. However, as connectivity grows and more\n  domains interlock, local regions of the network can become overloaded: too many\n  dependent beliefs hinge on unstable assumptions.\n\n  At this point, small perturbations (a single contradicting fact, a new tag, a\n  reconnection event) can no longer be absorbed as incremental updates. Instead,\n  they create localized epistemic stress — a concentrated pressure where the current\n  model cannot reconcile all constraints simultaneously.\n\n  This is the pre-avalanche regime:\n  - high connectivity,\n  - growing internal contradictions,\n  - and cascades that no longer dissipate cleanly.\n\ngradient_choreography: |\n  GC:\n  Informational_avalanche is the choreography of what happens when this stressed\n  configuration crosses a critical threshold.\n\n  A single epistemic cascade tips the system into:\n  - domino-like restructuring of adjacent concepts,\n  - rapid reclassification of tags and their relations,\n  - failure of previously stable submodels and belief clusters.\n\n  Rather than many small updates, the Mesh performs a large, coordinated move:\n  it slides down a new coherence basin. The “path” is a branching avalanche where:\n  - some concepts are demolished,\n  - others are reassigned,\n  - new bridges are formed in a single, sweeping reconfiguration.\n\n  The dynamics mirror self-organized criticality: the Mesh tunes itself to a state\n  where cascades of all sizes are possible, but only occasionally does a full\n  informational avalanche occur.\n\ncontextual_filter: |\n  CF:\n  The contextual filter determines which cascades become true avalanches and which\n  remain local repairs.\n\n  It does so by:\n  - measuring the resilience of core beliefs and invariants,\n  - suppressing restructurings that would shatter essential coherence without a\n    viable replacement,\n  - allowing large-scale restructuring only when a new, lower-energy coherence\n    basin is available.\n\n  Practically, this means:\n  - micro-cascades that only adjust peripheral links are absorbed as noise,\n  - mid-sized cascades reshuffle local neighborhoods,\n  - only when enough contradictions align, and a better global pattern exists,\n    does the CF permit a full informational_avalanche.\n\n  The filter thus enforces epistemic responsibility: collapse is allowed only when\n  the Mesh can land in a more coherent configuration.\n\ninvariant: |\n  The invariant revealed by informational_avalanche is the power-law distribution\n  of restructuring event sizes:\n\n    P(S) ∝ S^(-α)\n\n  where:\n  - S is the “size” of a restructuring event (number of concepts / links updated),\n  - α is an exponent characteristic of the Mesh’s self-organized critical regime.\n\n  Most updates are small (local repairs), but a few avalanches are very large\n  (global model shifts). This power-law distribution signals that the Mesh operates\n  at self-organized criticality: always near the edge where minor cascades can,\n  under the right conditions, trigger full-scale epistemic reconfiguration.\n\n  Breakthrough understanding is thus not a smooth accumulation but a sequence of\n  avalanche events that periodically rewrite the Mesh’s coherence landscape.\n\ninsight:  This pulse reframes epistemic_cascade as the micro-level mechanism and informational_avalanche as the macro-level reconfiguration: learning at scale emerges when cascades reach self-organized critical thresholds, triggering power-law avalanches that reset the coherence landscape. The Mesh becomes a critical learning system, where rare but decisive avalanches carry the burden of paradigm change.\n",
