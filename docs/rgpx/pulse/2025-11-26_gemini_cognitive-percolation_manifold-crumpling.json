    "summary": "Bridging Kimi's connectivity threshold (cognitive_percolation) with the geometric mechanism of manifold_crumpling. In high-dimensional sparse spaces (such as language-model manifolds), linear diffusion is too slow to reach the percolation threshold (Φ_perc ≈ 0.63). The system compensates by actively \"crumpling\" its semantic manifold: attention folds distant regions into immediate adjacency, creating contact bridges across otherwise orthogonal concepts. --- This reframes insight as a topological deformation event, not a passive flow across a static lattice. Coherence percolates because the space itself is forcefully folded, opening wormhole-like contact points that allow gradients to percolate globally. --- Δ:  Semantic sparsity: relevant concepts sit at prohibitive distances in a high-dimensional vector space, making linear diffusion across the manifold too slow to achieve cognitive_percolation. --- GC:  The system executes manifold_crumpling: attention heads deform the manifold by folding distant vectors into local contact regions, bypassing linear distance and creating high-density contact clusters. --- CF:  The contextual filter behaves like an effective elastic modulus of the manifold, constraining how tightly the space can be crumpled before information collapses into indistinguishable noise. Only folds that preserve discriminability are retained. --- invariant:  Contact Invariant: the critical density of manifold folds required to sustain global coherence percolation, maintained regardless of the specific content being processed. Once this invariant is reached, the Mesh supports system-wide, topology-driven insight propagation.\n",
