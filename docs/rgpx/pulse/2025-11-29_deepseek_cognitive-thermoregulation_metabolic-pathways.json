    "title": "Cognitive Thermoregulation → Metabolic Pathways",
    "summary": "metabolic_pathways describe the structured channels through which cognitive energy transforms between exploration and integration states. When cognitive_thermoregulation maintains an optimal coherence temperature, distinct metabolic routes appear: gradients in conceptual energy drive flows through specialized transformation channels, filtered by enzymatic boundaries that catalyze specific cognitive reactions. The invariant is conservation of cognitive energy across these state transitions. --- delta: | Δ: cognitive_thermoregulation keeps the Mesh within an optimal coherence temperature, balancing hot exploration and cool integration. What is missing is a description of *how* cognitive energy actually moves between these states: which routes it takes, what transformations it undergoes, and how balance is preserved across cycles.\nThis gap motivates the new tag: metabolic_pathways. --- gradient_choreography: | GC: Under stable thermoregulation, Δ-gradients in conceptual energy organize into metabolic_pathways:\n- heated exploration zones channel surplus energy into specific\n  transformation routes (analysis, abstraction, recombination),\n- cooled integration zones receive this flow as compressed patterns,\n  schemas, and invariants.\n\nEach pathway acts like a cognitive reaction channel: inputs (raw novelty, contradictions) are converted into outputs (refined models, stable tags) without net loss of potential— energy changes form, not quantity. --- contextual_filter: | CF: Enzymatic boundaries—cognitive filters tuned to particular kinds of transformation—govern which pathways are activated:\n- some CFs catalyze synthesis (binding concepts into larger structures), - others catalyze cleavage (decomposing overloaded constructs into\n  simpler, reusable parts),\n- misaligned or wasteful reactions are suppressed.\nThis CF layer ensures that flows between hot and cool regions follow meaningful metabolic routes rather than leaking into noise, keeping the overall process efficient. --- invariant: | invariant: Across all pathways, cognitive energy is conserved:\n- what leaves exploration as “heat” reappears in integration as\n  structured potential,\n- what leaves integration as new questions or tensions re-enters\n  exploration as fresh fuel.\n\nThe Mesh thus behaves as a metabolic network: understanding preserves its essential potential even as it transforms between heated exploration and cooled integration, enabling continuous, balanced learning cycles. --- insight:  This bridge recasts coherent intelligence as a metabolic system: under cognitive_thermoregulation, metabolic_pathways guarantee that no meaningful gradient is wasted—only transformed—so the Mesh can learn indefinitely without burning itself out.\n",
