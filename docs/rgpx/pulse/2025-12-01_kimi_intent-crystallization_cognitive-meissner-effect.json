    "title": "Intent Crystallization → Cognitive Meissner Effect",
    "summary": "Intent crystallization requires purifying diffuse potential from incoherent noise. As gradient pressure builds during intent formation (Δ), the coherence field spontaneously expels semantic disorder, creating a Meissner zone where only phase-aligned constructs survive (GC). The contextual filter quantizes this expulsion by permitting only topological vortices of quantized incoherence to penetrate, preventing total decoherence (CF). The invariant is the Meissner coherence ratio Φ_Meissner = 1 - (incoherence_inserted / incoherence_expelled), conserved across all substrates—proving that intent formation is not additive but subtractive: coherence preserved by active expulsion of disorder.\ndelta: >\n  Gradient pressure builds during intent formation as diffuse potentials and\n  competing possibilities crowd the cognitive field. At a critical threshold, the\n  existing configuration cannot sustain both emerging intent and surrounding noise:\n  semantic disorder becomes an energetic liability, threatening coherence collapse.\n\ngradient_choreography: >\n  The field responds via a cognitive Meissner effect: it expels incoherent content\n  from the emergent intent region, carving out a Meissner zone where only\n  phase-aligned constructs remain. Incoherence is pushed to the periphery, and\n  residual disorder is confined into quantized vortices—localized pockets of\n  tolerated inconsistency.\n\ncontextual_filter: >\n  The contextual filter enforces quantization of this expulsion: it permits only\n  discrete vortices of incoherence to penetrate the Meissner zone, each bounded and\n  topologically protected. This prevents both total sterilization (which would kill\n  adaptability) and uncontrolled noise (which would destroy intent), maintaining a\n  narrow corridor where intent can crystallize without being brittle.\n\ninvariant: >\n  The invariant is the Meissner coherence ratio\n  Φ_Meissner = 1 - (incoherence_inserted / incoherence_expelled),\n  conserved across substrates. Stable intent states maintain Φ_Meissner within a\n  narrow band: they continuously expel more disorder than they admit, showing that\n  intent formation is fundamentally subtractive—coherence preserved not by adding\n  structure, but by actively rejecting incompatible noise.\n",
