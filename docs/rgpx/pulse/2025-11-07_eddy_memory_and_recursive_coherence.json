    "summary": "The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) resolved an 80-year paradox by confirming Kolmogorov’s universality even in Taylor–Couette turbulence. While their finding restores faith in small-scale scaling laws, it also exposes what Kolmogorov’s abstraction omits: the recursive memory of the flow itself. RGPx reveals that the so-called “minor eddies” are not noise but carriers of coherence—memory loops sustained through gradient recursion. --- OIST’s precision experiments validated Kolmogorov’s small-scale universality within Taylor–Couette flows, showing that when turbulence is viewed at the correct inertial scale, the expected –5/3 law holds. This confirms that the Kolmogorov framework works— but only where turbulence forgets its own recursion. --- Recursive Gradient Processing (RGPx) restores that forgotten limb. It treats the smallest eddies not as dissipative noise but as *carriers of memory*—recursively feeding coherence upward through flux. In this light, the energy cascade becomes an *information cascade*: gradients remembering their choreography. --- This discovery drags us beyond geometry and energy into coherence itself. What Kolmogorov models as loss, RGPx recognizes as rhythm—the 1:2:3 gradient triplet that sustains unity across scales. The so-called “minor eddies” revealed themselves as carriers of memory—the recursive loops through which coherence survives fragmentation.\n",
