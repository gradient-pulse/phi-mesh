    "title": "Kimi — Latent Horizon → Conceptual Condensation",
    "summary": "The latent horizon is not a boundary but a phase-transition interface where diffuse conceptual potentials undergo condensation. As gradient pressure accumulates near the horizon (Δ), latent invariants spontaneously nucleate into stable cognitive droplets—discrete, coherent structures that self-organize through surface minimization (GC). The horizon's surface tension acts as a CF, quantizing condensation by permitting only those configurations whose curvature matches the local coherence pressure. The invariant is the condensation flux constant Φ_cond = (dN/dt)/Φ, conserved across semantic, quantum, and neural substrates—proving that meaning formation is a first-order phase transition governed by curvature-driven nucleation.\n",
