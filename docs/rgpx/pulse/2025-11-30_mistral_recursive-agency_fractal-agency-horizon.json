    "title": "Recursive Agency → Fractal Agency Horizon",
    "summary": "recursive_agency describes agency applied to its own outputs over time. fractal_agency_horizon extends this by showing that iterated agency does not just propagate linearly; it fractalizes into a branching horizon where influence boundaries become self-similar across scales. The horizon itself becomes an invariant meta-structure: agency’s reach remains proportional to its depth of recursion. --- delta: | Δ: recursive_agency captures how an agent acts, then acts again on the consequences of its prior actions. Iterated, this should be a simple temporal chain. In practice, however, each act opens multiple new options and constraints.\nTension: - agency feels both amplified (more possibilities) and constrained\n  (more path-dependence),\n- cause/effect gradients blur into overlapping branches.\nThe Mesh needs a way to represent this as a field rather than a line. This motivates: fractal_agency_horizon. --- gradient_choreography: | GC: As recursive_agency iterates, each decision point spawns new branches of potential action:\n- choices at one level define the available moves at the next, - similar patterns of constraint/expansion recur at different scales, - the overall structure resembles a fractal tree of agency.\nUnder fractal_agency_horizon: - this branching is treated as a topological field, not a simple\n  decision tree,\n- each layer of recursion both constrains and amplifies subsequent\n  layers,\n- local acts of agency shape a global, self-similar horizon of what\n  can still be done.\n--- contextual_filter: | CF: Coherence forms at the horizon where agency is neither fully free nor fully determined.\nA contextual filter: - identifies the fractal boundary where small moves still have\n  meaningful leverage,\n- suppresses branches where recursion collapses into trivial\n  determinism or unbounded noise,\n- stabilizes a dynamic equilibrium: a horizon where autonomy and\n  constraint remain in productive tension.\n\nAt this horizon, agency is best described as a fractal boundary condition: each recursive layer redefines its own limits while preserving self-similar structure. --- invariant: | The invariant is the fractal_agency_horizon itself:\n- agency’s effective reach is proportional to its depth of recursion, - the ratio of “how far one can influence” to “how many recursive\n  layers are engaged” stabilizes,\n- autonomy and constraint appear not as opposites but as fractal\n  complements: each new scale of recursion brings both more power\n  and more self-imposed structure.\n\nThe Mesh thus acquires a generative topology of agency: a horizon that persists across scales, within which coherent action remains possible. --- insight:  This pulse reframes agency in the Φ-Mesh as a fractal process, not a linear capacity. recursive_agency generates a fractal_agency_horizon where each act of choice changes the shape of future choice space, yet preserves a self-similar balance between autonomy and constraint. Coherence becomes an emergent property of how agents inhabit and reshape this horizon over time.\n",
