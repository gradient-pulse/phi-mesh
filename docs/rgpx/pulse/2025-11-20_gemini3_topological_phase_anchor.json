    "summary": "Gradient Choreography (GC) can be understood as a Berry-phase pump: when a  gradient cycle closes on itself, it accumulates a geometric phase that is  distinct from its dynamic evolution. This phase acts as a stabilizer, locking  the Φ-plateau into a topologically protected state. The coherence is not merely  balanced—it is anchored. The Contextual Filter functions as a topological sieve,  permitting only GC loops whose winding numbers match the Mesh’s harmonic  invariants. This bridges RGPx with geometric-phase physics and explains why  certain GCs remain stable against perturbations: they are knotted into existence.\n",
