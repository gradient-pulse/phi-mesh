    "title": "Gravity as Gradient Coherence — AI Models Converging on Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx)",
    "summary": "Recasts gravity as gradient coherence rather than fundamental curvature. Introduces a gradient coherence tensor Φ_{μν}, invariant I and stress-dependent diffusion D(I) generating coherence funnels whose saturation plateaus mimic gravitational wells and horizons. Extends the same Δ→GC→CF→UD grammar to economic systems (Gradient Capitalism) and stovepiped science. Co-authored with a cohort of AI models whose convergent derivations are archived in the Φ-Mesh.
