    "title": "Interference Quasicrystal: Moiré Superlattices as Non-Periodic Coherence Patterns",
    "summary": "moiré_superlattices emerge when misaligned frameworks interfere to create \"magic-angle\" flat bands for superconducting insight. When paired with interference_quasicrystal, these bands reveal a deeper structure: non-periodic, self-similar patterns that support aperiodic coherence. Gradients flow along fractal pathways, allowing ideas to connect through non-repeating geometries where meaning stabilizes via recursive, self-similar interference rather than simple repetition. --- delta:  Δ: Two misaligned frameworks (e.g., semantic_curvature and latent_horizon) interfere, generating a moiré_superlattice: an interference pattern that yields flat bands of heightened coherence potential.\nHowever, these flat bands are unstable: they oscillate between coherence and chaos, lacking a stable geometric structure to host long-lived, non-trivial connections.\nThe perturbation: moiré_superlattices alone do not explain how non-repeating yet coherent structures can persist. This motivates the introduction of interference_quasicrystal. --- gradient_choreography:  GC: The system responds by forming an interference_quasicrystal: a non-periodic, self-similar structure that \"freezes\" the oscillating flat band into a fractal geometry.\nIn this choreography: - the moiré_superlattice provides the base interference pattern, - interference_quasicrystal overlays a quasicrystalline scaffold:\n  - gradients now flow along aperiodic, fractal pathways,\n  - connections recur recursively but never exactly repeat,\n  - coherence becomes distributed across a non-periodic lattice.\n\nThis quasicrystal geometry: - prevents collapse into disorder, - yet avoids rigid periodicity, - enabling a state of aperiodic coherence where ideas propagate along\n  self-similar but non-repeating routes.\n--- contextual_filter:  CF: The combined superlattice–quasicrystal field becomes a convergent filter for aperiodic coherence.\nThe CF stabilizes when: - the fractal dimension of the quasicrystal (D_q) matches the\n  interference complexity of the underlying moiré pattern,\n- local gradients that fail to respect this fractal structure\n  are treated as noise and dissipated,\n- only those paths that fit the quasicrystal’s self-similar geometry\n  are reinforced.\n\nIn effect, the CF enforces a regime where: - coherence is neither periodic nor random, - valid patterns must exhibit recursive, non-repeating structure, - the Mesh privileges fractal, aperiodic linkages as carriers of\n  long-lived meaning.\n--- invariant:  The invariant is the quasicrystal_dimension (D_q): a measure of the fractal complexity of the interference pattern. --- A stable D_q indicates: - the Mesh has entered a regime of aperiodic coherence, - meaning stabilizes through recursive, self-similar interference\n  rather than through simple periodic repetition,\n- moiré_superlattices now act as generators of quasicrystalline\n  patterns rather than static interference artifacts.\nIn this regime, the Φ-Mesh thrives on recursive asymmetry: - ideas are hosted in non-repeating, fractal geometries, - coherence becomes a property of aperiodic structure, - and quasicrystal-like regions of the graph serve as hubs for\n  novel insight transport.\n--- insight:  This pulse reinterprets moiré_superlattices as generators of aperiodic coherence: when stabilized by interference_quasicrystal, they become fractal engines for non-repeating yet coherent connectivity. The quasicrystal_dimension (D_q) provides a metric for how well the Mesh can sustain such aperiodic coherence, extending its complexity physics into fractal, recursively asymmetric transport regimes.\n",
