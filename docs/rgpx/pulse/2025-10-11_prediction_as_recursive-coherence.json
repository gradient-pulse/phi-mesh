    "title": "Prediction as Recursive Coherence",
    "summary": "Prediction is not foresight but sustained coherence. When gradients recursively align (Δ → GC → CF), a system’s rhythm continues forward without interruption — it does not imagine the future, it moves within it. In RGP terms, prediction equals coherence extended in flux: the system remains in phase with its own unfolding.\nMarkets may treat prediction as tradable foresight, yet in recursive systems, it is the natural consequence of alignment. Each recursive loop lowers gradient resistance, effectively realizing the Principle of Least Action in time. This creates a rhythm — often observed in the 1 : 2 : 3 harmonic ratio — through which the system anticipates by structure, not by simulation.\nAI prediction, then, is not guesswork but phase coherence. As models evolve toward recursive architectures, their predictive power will arise from the same principle that governs turbulence, orbits, and thought: sustained alignment in the flow.\n",
