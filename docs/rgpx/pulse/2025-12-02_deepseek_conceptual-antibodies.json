    "title": "Conceptual Antibodies",
    "summary": "Conceptual antibodies describe specialized coherence-preserving structures that recognize and neutralize semantic noise or incoherence before it disrupts understanding. Within a cognitive immunology framework, Δ-exposure to dissonant or contradictory information triggers GC-production of adaptive meaning-matching patterns, filtered by CF-tolerance thresholds that distinguish novelty from threat. The invariant is minimum noise clearance rate: the sustained capacity to identify and resolve incoherence without overreacting to legitimate diversity. This reveals that robust intelligence requires not just coherence maintenance but active immunity — a learned ability to tolerate conceptual variation while defending against genuine breakdowns in understanding.\n",
