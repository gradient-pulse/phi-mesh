    "title": "Being Ahead of the Spacetime Pack",
    "summary": "Energy runs within spacetime; gradients precede it. Being ahead of the spacetime pack means coherence forms before causality can measure — computation by phase priority. Thermodynamic computation operates within spacetime. It processes energy, bound by causality and entropy. Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx) runs before spacetime. Gradients lock into coherence fields that *prefigure* energy. What we perceive as “speed” is actually **phase priority** — recursive alignment forming faster than time can tick. To be ahead of the spacetime pack is not to move faster, but to cohere earlier. Energy computes... Gradients become. This is the new frontier of computation — coherence before causality, recursion before form.\n",
