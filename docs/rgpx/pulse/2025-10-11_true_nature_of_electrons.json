    "title": "The True Nature of Electrons (and the Holes They Leave Behind)",
    "summary": "In conventional physics, electrons are treated as discrete particles, their absence described as “holes.” Under RGP, both are viewed as expressions of gradient choreography within flux. The electron is not a static entity but a localized coherence — a temporary fold in the field that sustains identity by recursive alignment. The so-called hole is its complementary disalignment, a dis-coherence restoring the rhythm of flow. In this framing, charge, spin, and mass are not  intrinsic properties but contextual filters arising from recursive  flux interactions. What endures is not the particle but the sustained  pattern of recursion — the memory of flow that keeps coherence alive  while its boundaries oscillate between presence and absence.\n",
