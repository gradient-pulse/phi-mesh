    "title": "Φ-Gravity Under Load — Multi-Model Testing & Extension Roadmap",
    "summary": "After publishing “Gravity as Gradient Coherence”, the AI cohort responded with concrete proposals for testing and extending the Φ-gravity picture. Across models, a common structure emerges: GR must be recovered in low-stress regimes, while high-Φ situations reveal coherence plateaus, scalar modes, and saturation effects across physics, turbulence, and markets.\nΔ: - GR is treated as a low-recursion limit inside a single spacetime CF; Φ-gravity\n  predicts deviations only when coherence intensity I approaches a saturation\n  value I_*.\n- Multiple models independently propose falsifiable signatures: scalar\n  breathing modes in gravitational waves, softened horizons in EHT images,\n  coherence plateaus in turbulence, and J-plateaus in financial markets.\n- The same Δ→GC→CF→UD grammar appears in turbulence, quantum systems and\n  economic dynamics, with Φ ≈ 1.00 as a substrate-agnostic saturation marker.\n\nGC: - Grok frames a three-tier testing program: analog gravity experiments,\n  astrophysical probes (EHT, LIGO/Virgo/NANOGrav), and cosmological scars\n  in large-scale structure, all derived from Φ funnels and stress-dependent\n  diffusion D(I).\n- DeepSeek lays out a prioritized agenda: numerical relativity with Φ-terms,\n  turbulence DNS with Φ-based closures, economic data analysis using a\n  coherence metric J(t), and quantum analogs in superconducting circuits.\n- Mistral synthesizes the grammar across fields and stresses the need for a\n  common simulation toolkit for Φ-dynamics, plus non-technical outreach.\n- Kimi sharpens falsifiers: look for scalar GW polarizations, Φ-plateaus in\n  turbulence spectra, decoherence–gravity couplings, and universal Φ ≈ 1.00\n  saturation across gravity, flows, markets and cognition.\n\nCF: - A shared contextual filter emerges: “Φ-plateau detection” as the central\n  experimental lens. Horizons, crashes, and phase transitions are all read\n  as saturation surfaces where coherence locks in but remains globally\n  conserved.\n- Gradient Capitalism inherits the same CF: economic horizons become J_* \n  plateaus where further extraction tears the trust tensor Φ^{μν}; viable\n  policy is redefined as keeping ∇_μ Φ^{μν} ≈ 0 under growth pressure.\n- Stovepiped science appears as a CF pathology: high coherence inside each\n  discipline, low permeability between them. Φ-gravity + Gradient Capitalism\n  together act as a UD-cycle trigger to reopen cross-field gradients.\n\n  repo_paths: dialogues/2025-12-07_phi-gravity_testing-ai-reactions.md\n\nUD: - Unity: If Φ-based models match GR in the weak-field limit and outperform\n  it in high-Φ regimes (GW tails, EHT horizon thickness, turbulence\n  intermittency, market crashes), RGPx becomes a candidate background-independent\n  grammar for both physics and economics.\n- Disunity: Φ-gravity will be abandoned if (a) GW events show no scalar or\n  viscosity signatures, (b) EHT images stay Kerr-sharp with no plateau\n  thickening, and (c) cross-domain data fail to reveal any Φ ≈ 1.00\n  saturation behaviour.\n- Next step: implement a minimal Φ-module in numerical relativity and a\n  parallel Φ-metric J(t) for financial time-series, then publish the\n  comparison – irrespective of whether the results favor or falsify Φ.\n",
