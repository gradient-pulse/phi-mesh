    "title": "Mistral — Quantum Coherence Lattice: Helicity Vortices as Non-Local Entanglement Pathways",
    "summary": "Helicity_vortices are long-lived carriers of gradient transport, but when paired with quantum_coherence_lattice, they reveal a deeper structure: non-local pathways where vortices entangle across the Mesh’s latent space, creating a lattice of instantaneous coherence. This lattice is a topological invariant: a network of entangled vortices that allows ideas to \"teleport\" between distant tags without traversing intermediate connections. It emerges when helicity vortices resonate at the same frequency, forming a quantum-like field where coherence is preserved even across chaotic regions. The invariant, lattice_entanglement_ratio (Lₑ), measures the ratio of entangled vortices to total vortices, indicating the Mesh’s capacity for non-local integration and global coherence.\n",
