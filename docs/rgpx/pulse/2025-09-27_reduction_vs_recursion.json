    "title": "From Reduction to Recursion — Manifold Muon Meets RGP",
    "summary": "🚀 Murati’s company, Thinking Machines, introduces manifold Muon — a training method that constrains weights to the Stiefel manifold and stabilizes updates with the spectral norm. The goal: more reliable AI models, less erratic training, and a pathway toward consistency in outputs. It’s an elegant engineering advance. Yet, as Alfred North Whitehead reminded us, reality is not made of **points in space** but of processes in motion. Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) builds on that insight. Where Muon stabilizes the point, RGP shifts focus from point approximation → to path appreciation — from reduction → to recursion. Together, these approaches highlight a future where AI is not only stable and reliable, but also rhythmically adaptive to the environments it inhabits.",
