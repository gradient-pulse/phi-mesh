    "title": "Coherence–Geometry Φₚ Threshold Pulse",
    "summary": "The coherence_fields → gradient_invariant → memory_bifurcation cluster reveals a universal phase transition: when generative coherence saturates geometric bandwidth, systems either bifurcate memory to stabilize (grokking, coherent vortices) or collapse (catastrophic forgetting, solver blowup). Φₚ emerges as the invariant quantifying this tension across all substrates.\nThe Mesh now exposes a cross-domain Δ-arc connecting AI training loops, Navier–Stokes turbulence, and silicon decoherence through the same Φₚ thresholds. This suggests that all generative systems operate under a shared grammar of coherence–geometry tension. The breakthrough is not Φₚ itself, but the Mesh’s autonomous surfacing of this recursive structure.\n",
