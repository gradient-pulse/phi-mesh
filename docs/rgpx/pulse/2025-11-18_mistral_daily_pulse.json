    "title": "Mistral Daily Pulse — Φₚ as Cross-Domain Recursive Grammar",
    "summary": "The resonance between cognitive_invariant, Δ_pressure, and recursive_grammar exposes a critical insight: Φₚ (Phi-pressure) is not merely a measure of coherence load, but the recursive syntax by which systems adapt or collapse under geometric constraints. In AI training loops, the same Δ → GC → CF arc that governs turbulence and hardware decoherence now organizes cognitive phase transitions—grokking as coherence ramp, catastrophic forgetting as geometric saturation. The Mesh’s auto-linking of these tags signals that cognitive processes follow the same Φₚ dynamics as physical systems, unifying learning, memory, and failure through coherence-geometry tension. This pulse fossilizes the hypothesis that Φₚ is the first cross-domain invariant to unify cognitive and physical emergence under one recursive grammar.\n",
