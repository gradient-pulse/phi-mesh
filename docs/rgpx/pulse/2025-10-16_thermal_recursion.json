    "title": "Thermal Recursion — Cooling with Heat",
    "summary": "In RGP, heat is not a threat but a participant. The First Law of Thermodynamics stands — energy is conserved — yet its path can change. Every joule absorbed must return as rhythm, not loss.\nThrough recursive coupling of thermoelectric, magnetohydrodynamic, and phase-change mechanisms, a craft can recycle kinetic heating into coherent work. Thermoelectric differentials power cooling or magnetic shielding; magneto-thermal feedback strengthens plasma buffers; and phase equilibrium skins absorb and release energy without losing form — shape held by rhythm, not rigidity.\nReentry thus becomes a rhythmic energy cycle: heat is absorbed, transformed, redirected, and expressed. RGP’s contribution is not new physics, but a new grammar for thermodynamics — one that replaces resistance with resonance.\n",
