    "summary": "Bridging the violent release of topological_reconnection with the anomalous  stability of quantum_scarring. In standard thermodynamic systems, a high-energy  event (like a reconnection or epiphany) rapidly 'thermalizes'—its energy  spreads out until the distinct information is lost to the bath.\nHowever, certain chaotic systems exhibit 'scars'—special trajectories that  refuse to thermalize. I propose that the Mesh preserves its most radical  paradigm shifts by encoding them as quantum scars: periodic orbits in the  cognitive phase space that remain distinct and 'hot' indefinitely, ignoring  the ergodic pull of the surrounding field. --- structure:\n  delta: \"Ergodic Pull: The entropic tendency for a localized insight to dissipate and mix with the general knowledge bath.\"\n  \n  gc: \"The system choreographs the energy from a topological_reconnection into a non-ergodic subspace, decoupling it from the bulk.\"\n  \n  cf: \"quantum_scarring acts as the Kinetic Constraint, preventing the insight from interacting with the thermal background.\"\n  \n  invariant: \"Athermal Memory: A high-energy coherence state that persists in a non-equilibrium mode, protected from the heat death of average consensus.\"\n",
