    "title": "Seeking raw FD datasets — JHTDB vs NASA",
    "summary": "Our test with NASA’s DNS confirmed a crucial lesson: pre-averaged or filtered data is not acceptable for NT-rhythm analysis — it reflects institutional lenses, not nature’s coherence ratios. JHTDB has served us with pure probe-level series, but NASA’s archives do not. We are now searching for alternative FD databases, with our current bet on KTH’s DNS archives (Sweden), which offer NetCDF/HDF5 downloads similar to JHTDB.\nGoal: locate turbulence DNS sources that provide raw, probe-level time series untouched by pre-processing. Suggestions welcome.",
