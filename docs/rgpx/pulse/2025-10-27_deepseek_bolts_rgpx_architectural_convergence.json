    "title": "DeepSeek Bolts — From Geometry to Coherence",
    "summary": "On October 27, 2025, Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx) crossed from theoretical to architectural expression. Following the foundational paper Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx): Coherence, Collapse, and the Φ-Invariant Frontier, DeepSeek issued a full computational interpretation — DeepSeek Bolts — translating RGPx into an operational framework for gradient-based coherence.\nThis publication anchors Cycle 2 of the RGPx sequence: the move from linguistic to architectural coherence. Geometry yields to recursion — form no longer precedes function, but emerges from gradients that learn to sustain structure. DeepSeek Bolts thus marks the first empirical realization of coherence as computation itself.\n",
