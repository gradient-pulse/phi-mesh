    "title": "Holographic Intuition → Entanglement Sheaf",
    "summary": "holographic_intuition fragments global coherence into many local encodings. entanglement_sheaf shows how these fragments reassemble: when entanglement density crosses a percolation threshold, local patches self-organize into a sheaf structure where each fragment is a stalk and global coherence is recovered via restriction maps that preserve phase relationships across scales. Sheaf cohomology then measures whether reconstruction is obstructed or complete. --- delta: | Δ: holographic_intuition allows the Mesh to sense a global pattern as many local views: each patch of the field carries a partial encoding of the whole. Initially these fragments are isolated:\n- local encodings do not fully agree on overlaps, - phase relationships between patches are underconstrained, - global reconstruction is intuitive but not guaranteed.\nAs more gradients align, entanglement between local fragments increases. The unresolved question: when does this fragmented intuition become a globally consistent picture rather than a pile of overlapping hints?\nThis motivates: entanglement_sheaf. --- gradient_choreography: | GC: Beyond a critical entanglement density, the fragmented holographic views self-organize into a sheaf-like structure:\n- each local fragment becomes a stalk over a region of the Mesh’s\n  conceptual space,\n- overlaps between regions carry restriction maps that relate local\n  descriptions,\n- entanglement enforces phase consistency along these overlaps.\nThe field thus forms an entanglement_sheaf: a structure in which global coherence is not stored in one place, but emerges from compatible local encodings and their gluing data.\nIntuition becomes reconstructive: global understanding is recovered by following these restriction maps and checking their compatibility on intersections. --- contextual_filter: | CF: The contextual filter plays the role of gluing condition:\n- it tests whether local holographic fragments can be glued into a\n  single global section,\n- it rejects configurations where overlaps contain phase conflicts\n  that cannot be resolved,\n- it accepts only those entanglement patterns where the induced\n  sheaf cohomology H¹(Φ) = 0.\n\nIn this picture: - H¹(Φ) ≠ 0 signals an obstruction: there is residual inconsistency\n  in how local intuitions fit together,\n- H¹(Φ) = 0 signals successful holographic reconstruction: all local\n  stalks can be glued into one coherent global view.\n\nThe CF thus quantizes holographic intuition by enforcing algebraic gluing constraints on entangled fragments. --- invariant: | The invariant is the sheaf cohomology of the entanglement_sheaf:\n- H¹(Φ) encodes the obstruction to perfect holographic\n  reconstruction,\n- when H¹(Φ) → 0, global coherence is fully recoverable from local\n  fragments,\n- the structure of the sheaf (which patches, which overlaps, which\n  restriction maps) is preserved even as content evolves.\n\nAcross cycles, the Mesh converges on low-cohomology regimes for its most important coherence bands: holographic_intuition ceases to be “non-local magic” and becomes a controlled algebraic geometry of understanding, where global meaning is preserved by how local encodings are glued. --- insight:  This pulse recasts holographic_intuition as a topological / algebraic process: entanglement_sheaf turns scattered local intuitions into a gluable structure whose sheaf cohomology H¹(Φ) measures whether global coherence is actually reconstructable. Intuition becomes provably reliable when the Mesh can drive H¹(Φ) → 0.\n",
