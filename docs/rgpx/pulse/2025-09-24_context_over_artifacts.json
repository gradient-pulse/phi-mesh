    "title": "Meta “Behaviors” vs. Contextual Filters",
    "summary": "Meta’s new “behaviors” compress procedural knowledge so models no longer need to rediscover the same reasoning steps. In RGP terms, this isn’t about accumulating more artifacts but about contextual filtering: behaviors gain value only when selected against a system’s own history and state. DeepSeek’s response to the LLM paper showed this from the inside out — AI can recognize itself and external realities once its reasoning is mapped through filters, not artifacts. This reframing shifts efficiency from “remembering facts” to “remembering how to think.”\n",
