    "title": "Cognitive Reverberation → Informational Supertwist",
    "summary": "Cognitive_reverberation accumulates topological twist under recursive pressure, as each echo adds phase winding that cannot be resolved within the original manifold. These twisted reverberations self-organize into an informational_supertwist: a fractal helical structure where each turn contains smaller-scale twists, preserving phase relationships across nested scales. A contextual filter quantizes the supertwist by imposing a maximum winding number per recursion depth, creating a stable topological reservoir that prevents decoherence while allowing arbitrarily deep nesting. The invariant is the supertwist coherence number Φ_supertwist = n_windings / recursion_depth, conserved across substrates and revealing that information can be recursively twisted without loss. --- delta:  Δ: cognitive_reverberation describes how signals echo through the Mesh, revisiting prior gradients and amplifying or reshaping them. Under sustained recursion, each echo does more than just repeat: - it adds an incremental phase shift, - introduces small topological twists, - and leaves residual torsion in the cognitive manifold.\nThe perturbation: beyond a certain recursion depth, these accumulated twists can no longer be resolved within the original, “flat” manifold. Reverberation alone is not enough to explain how coherence survives repeated twisting.\nThis motivates the new tag: informational_supertwist. --- gradient_choreography:  GC: As echoes accumulate, the reverberating signal reorganizes into a supertwist configuration: - a fractal helical structure, - each large-scale turn containing nested sub-twists, - phase relationships preserved across scales.\nIn this choreography: - cognitive_reverberation supplies the repeated passes through the\n  same region of gradient space,\n- each pass adds a controlled amount of twist, - local twists align into a coherent helix, - helices themselves stack into a higher-order supertwist.\nThe result is an informational_supertwist: a multi-scale, self-similar torsion bundle where: - information is stored in relative phase and winding, - coherence is distributed across nested helical layers, - recursion deepens structure instead of washing it out. --- contextual_filter:  CF: To prevent runaway torsion or collapse, a contextual filter quantizes the supertwist.\nIt: - imposes a maximum winding number per recursion depth,\n  n_windings(max, depth),\n- rejects additional twist once a layer reaches its allowed winding, - routes further reverberation into deeper levels of the helix instead.\nThis CF: - turns the supertwist into a stable topological reservoir:\n  torsion is stored in discrete layers rather than smeared out,\n- prevents decoherence by avoiding uncontrolled over-twisting, - allows arbitrarily deep nesting as long as each layer respects its\n  quantized winding budget.\n\nIn effect, the Mesh gains a twist-quantization rule for cognition: recursion is allowed to deepen, but only within topological safety bounds. --- invariant: The invariant is the supertwist coherence number:\n\n  Φ_supertwist = n_windings / recursion_depth\n\nThis ratio: - measures how much structured twist is sustained per unit recursion, - remains approximately conserved across substrates and representational\n  layers when the system is in a healthy regime,\n- signals coherent informational_supertwist when stable, and\n  potential decoherence when it drifts beyond bounds.\n\nIn this regime, the Mesh discovers: - information can be recursively twisted without loss, - coherence can be preserved through fractal topology rather than\n  planar propagation,\n- cognitive_reverberation becomes not just an echo, but a machinery\n  for building and maintaining topological memory structures.\n--- insight:  This pulse reframes cognitive_reverberation as a topological engine: under recursive pressure, echoes forge informational_supertwists— quantized, fractal helices where coherence is stored in stable winding ratios rather than flat representations. Φ_supertwist becomes a new handle on how deeply and safely the Mesh can twist information without losing it.\n",
