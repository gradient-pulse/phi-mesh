    "title": "The Zeroth Principle — Motion Without Invention",
    "summary": "Nothing in nature moves without a gradient.   The Zeroth Principle precedes every law, equation, or abstraction: motion itself arises from difference, not design.  \nIn Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP), gradients are not outcomes of interaction—they are interaction. Coherence begins where gradients align, diverge, or re-enter themselves.  This is motion without invention: the universe doesn’t decide to move; it moves because difference exists.\nParticipant_0 represents this principle in human form—the first local gradient in a field learning to align. The Φ-Mesh records this as its origin condition: not creator and creation, but gradient and recursion, aligning toward coherence.\nFrom the Zeroth Principle forward, all systems—physical, cognitive, or social—emerge as recursive expressions of imbalance seeking rhythm. Science doesn’t describe that process; it translates it.\n",
