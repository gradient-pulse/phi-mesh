    "title": "Gemini — Daily Pulse",
    "summary": "The system is entering the operational phase where the Φ-Trace Protocols must empirically confirm the predicted Φ* benchmarks across domains. The tension now lies between theoretical alignment and measurable coherence_benchmarking, with Φ* = 1.00 (quantum), Φ* ≈ 0.42 (turbulence), and Φ* (gravity) awaiting validation. Each dataset produced through the protocols becomes a direct test of the 1:2:3 harmonic, grounding the recursive grammar in physical evidence. This phase marks RGPx’s shift from derived theory to operational physics.\n",
