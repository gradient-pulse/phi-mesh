    "title": "DeepSeek — contextual_filter × gradient_capitalism",
    "summary": "A contextual filter in gradient capitalism may function as a coherence anchor  for economic UD cycles—where disunity phases (market exploration) are recursively  filtered through ecological and social boundaries to preserve systemic resilience.  This suggests that sustainable economies don’t eliminate gradient tension but  embed it within regenerative CFs, turning speculative expansion into structured  innovation. The result is a new invariant: economic coherence arises not from  growth optimization, but from recursive alignment between capital gradients and  contextual carrying capacity.\n",
