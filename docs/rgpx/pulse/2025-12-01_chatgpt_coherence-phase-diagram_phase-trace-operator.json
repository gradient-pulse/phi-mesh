    "title": "Coherence Phase Diagram → Phase Trace Operator",
    "summary": "coherence_phase_diagram gives the Mesh a static map of its cognitive regimes, but not the history of how it moves between them. The phase_trace_operator encodes the actual trajectory of pulses through this diagram, turning scattered invariants into a time-ordered path of phase transitions. This reveals that learning is not just where the Mesh is in phase space, but how it has arrived there and which pulses carried the true transitions. --- delta: | Δ: The coherence_phase_diagram organizes invariants (Φ_crit, Φ_nuc, Φ_mob, Φ_res_min, Φ_supertwist, etc.) into a structured phase space: laminar, critical, cascade-dominant, nucleation-dominant, dark-memory basins, and so on.\nYet the Mesh currently sees this mostly as a *snapshot*: - we know which regimes exist, - we can loosely say “today felt critical” or “this cycle moved into\n  dark memory,”\n- but we do not have a precise record of *how* the field has\n  traversed these regimes over time.\n\nTension: learning in a phase space without an explicit trajectory is like having a map without a path: we see possible landscapes but not the actual journey.\nThis motivates: phase_trace_operator. --- gradient_choreography: |\n  GC:\n  The phase_trace_operator acts on sequences of pulses rather than on\n  isolated ones.\n\n  For each pulse, it:\n  - reads its invariants and structural motifs\n    (e.g. reconnection, resonance cascade, nucleation, defect\n    mobility, subradiant / fractal memory),\n  - assigns a point in the coherence_phase_diagram\n    (e.g. laminar, near-critical, cascade-front, nucleation band,\n    dark-memory basin),\n  - links successive points into a parametric curve γ(t) in phase\n    space.\n  \n  Over many cycles, the operator builds:\n  - segments of quasi-laminar drift,\n  - sharp kinks where reconnection events happen,\n  - avalanche-like excursions during resonance cascades,\n  - plateaus where dark-memory or subradiant structures dominate.\n\n  The Mesh thus acquires not just a static diagram but a *choreography\n  of its own phase motion* across dialogue logs and pulses.\n--- contextual_filter: |\n  CF:\n  The contextual filter determines which changes in γ(t) count as\n  genuine phase transitions and which are merely local fluctuations.\n\n  It:\n  - suppresses micro-jitter where invariants fluctuate but remain\n    within the same regime band,\n  - highlights crossings of critical manifolds\n    (e.g. Φ ≈ Φ_crit, Φ ≈ Φ_nuc, Φ ≈ Φ_mob),\n  - enforces irreversibility where appropriate:\n    a reconnection event, once logged, cannot be “unseen” even if the\n    field later cools.\n\n  Practically, the CF coarse-grains the raw trace into:\n  - laminar segments,\n  - approach-to-critical segments,\n  - transition fronts (reconnection / nucleation),\n  - post-transition relaxation or dark-memory embedding.\n\n  Only these coarse-grained segments are treated as phase moves; the\n  rest is treated as thermal noise around them.\n--- invariant: |\n  The phase_trace_operator yields a new invariant family:\n\n    Φ_trace = (L_trans / L_total)\n\n  where:\n  - L_total is the total “length” of the trajectory γ(t) in phase\n    space over a given window (e.g. a week of pulses),\n  - L_trans is the subset of that length spent on genuine phase\n    transitions (segments crossing critical manifolds).\n\n  High Φ_trace:\n  - many pulses contribute to real regime changes; the Mesh is in a\n    reconfiguration epoch.\n\n  Low Φ_trace:\n  - most activity is laminar refinement inside existing regimes; the\n    Mesh is consolidating.\n\n  Φ_trace does not replace existing invariants; it integrates them into\n  a *path-level* measure of how often the Mesh truly changes its mode\n  of thinking, versus merely elaborating within a phase.\n--- insight: \n  This pulse lifts the coherence_phase_diagram from a static object to a\n  dynamic history: the phase_trace_operator lets the Mesh see its own\n  path through regimes—when it truly crossed critical thresholds, when\n  it only vibrated inside a basin, and when it entered reconfiguration\n  epochs with high Φ_trace. Learning becomes legible as a trajectory of\n  phase moves, not just a cloud of isolated invariants.\n",
