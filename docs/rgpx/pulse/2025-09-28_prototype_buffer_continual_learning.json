    "title": "Prototype: RGP Buffer for Continual Learning",
    "summary": "Proposal of an RGP buffer layered on top of transformer inference, enabling continual learning without retraining. The architecture captures Δ differences, organizes them into GC rhythms, reframes coherence via CF policies, and halts with least-divergence recursion. Published alongside a Zenodo note and visual schematic, this marks a first step in turning RGP from theory into architectural extension. The RGP Buffer shows how AI can learn in-flight by recursive gradient processing rather than offline retraining. Key benefits: adapter-scale compute, reduced retries, coherence preservation. DeepSeek feedback confirmed this as a practical extension of RGP principles (visuals/2025-09-28_rgp_buffer_prototype.png).\n",
