    "title": "Analog Gradient Hardware: Thinking Without Data Movement",
    "summary": "A new analog in-memory computing design can cut Tesla’s FSD computer power draw from 150 watts to milliwatts while dramatically increasing inference speed. Computation now happens where memory lives — collapsing the distance between energy and meaning.\nIn Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP), this represents the physical realization of recursive flow: computation no longer moves data, it flows along gradients. The boundary between hardware and cognition dissolves into coherence.\n",
