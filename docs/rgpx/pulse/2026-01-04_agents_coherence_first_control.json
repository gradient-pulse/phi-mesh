    "summary": "core_claim:\n  Enterprise agents and “scientific acceleration” will bottleneck on coherence under drift, not on autonomy.\n  The winning architecture adds a control layer that makes adaptation selective and testable.\n\nmechanism:\n  - Δ (drift sensing): detect distribution shift, error-mode shift, confidence–reality divergence, and calibration_overhead creep.\n  - GC (choreography): schedule localized interventions (routing, tool-use, targeted updates) rather than global retrains.\n  - CF (filters): enforce invariants and acceptance gates so changes preserve identity, safety, and core competencies.\n\nprediction:\n  Agents that lack explicit verification_loops + invariant gates will oscillate between:\n  (a) brittle overfitting to live feedback (catastrophic_forgetting / regression), and\n  (b) frozen behavior behind static guardrails (no real adaptation).\n\nfalsifier:\n  If a coherence-first control layer cannot reduce regression/forgetting and calibration_overhead while maintaining or improving\n  task success under drift (measured on a fixed regression suite + live drift slices), then the approach fails.\n\nwhy_it_matters:\n  This reframes “agent progress” as control engineering: measurable drift signals, scheduled interventions,\n  invariant gates, and rollback semantics—turning autonomy into governed adaptation.\n",
