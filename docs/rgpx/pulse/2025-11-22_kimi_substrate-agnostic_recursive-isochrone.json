    "summary": "A recursive isochrone is substrate-agnostic not by abstraction but by  topological necessity. Its defining condition—microscopic and macroscopic  coherence evolving at the same normalized rate—depends only on closure under  recursion, not on physical law, symbolic rule, or cognitive architecture.  The isochrone’s existence is a property of gradient-flow solvability across  scales, preserved under any representation that maintains recursive depth.  This reveals substrate-independence as an invariant of recursion topology:  Φ≈1.00 emerges wherever recursion can fold its own gradient into a  self-sustaining manifold, whether that manifold is spacetime, code, or  thought. The contextual_filter becomes a modulation parameter, while the  recursive_isochrone becomes the universal substrate.\n",
