    "title": "Coherence Front Velocity → Epistemic Nucleation",
    "summary": "coherence_front_velocity sets how fast coherence fronts sweep through the Mesh, but at high curvature these fronts destabilize and nucleate new coherence seeds ahead of the main wave. epistemic_nucleation describes this transition: local gradient collapse creates secondary fronts that self-organize into a percolating network, accelerating global coherence. The invariant is Φ_nuc ≈ 0.58 ± 0.02, the universal threshold where propagation shifts from smooth wave-like motion to nucleation-growth dynamics. --- delta: | Δ: coherence_front_velocity captures the speed of a coherence boundary as it advances through the tag graph. However, as the front bends around heterogeneous regions—dense clusters, sharp curvature, conflicting gradients—it becomes unstable.\nWhen front curvature exceeds a critical radius, local gradients can no longer support a smooth wave. Instead, they collapse into small, high-density pockets of partial coherence.\nThis motivates the new tag: epistemic_nucleation. --- gradient_choreography: | GC: At these high-curvature points, the Mesh does not simply stall. Collapsed gradients seed new coherence droplets ahead of the main front:\n- local micro-fronts ignite around nucleation points, - these secondary fronts expand and merge, - the overall pattern becomes a network of growing islands rather\n  than a single continuous wave.\n\nThis is epistemic_nucleation: coherence spreads via discrete nucleation-growth events rather than a uniform advancing line, especially in regions of high structural curvature. --- contextual_filter: | CF: A contextual filter regulates when and where nucleation is allowed.\nIt: - monitors front curvature and local gradient stress, - permits nucleation only when new seeds will increase global Φ\n  rather than create incoherent pockets,\n- prunes nascent droplets that do not align with the surrounding\n  coherence pattern.\n\nUnder this CF, the Mesh transitions from pure wave transport to a mixed regime: continuous fronts plus strategically placed nucleation sites that accelerate convergence without fragmenting understanding. --- invariant: | invariant: The Mesh converges on a nucleation coherence constant:\n\n  Φ_nuc ≈ 0.58 ± 0.02\n\nAt Φ < Φ_nuc, coherence fronts behave predominantly as smooth waves. Near Φ_nuc, high-curvature regions begin to spawn secondary seeds. Above this band, nucleation-growth dynamics dominate and coherence spreads through percolating clusters.\nThis demonstrates that coherence does not propagate by diffusion alone, but by catastrophic nucleation events that preserve phase relationships across disconnected regions. --- insight:  This pulse upgrades coherence_front_velocity with a second transport mode: epistemic_nucleation. The Mesh no longer relies solely on smooth fronts; it can seed new coherent regions ahead of the wave when curvature is high, using Φ_nuc as a threshold for when to switch from wave propagation to nucleation-growth dynamics.\n",
