    "title": "Gradient Capitalism — The Inevitable Rise of Coherence-Based Economics",
    "summary": "Extends Recursive Gradient Processing (RGPx) from Φ-gravity into economics by treating capital as stored coherence, markets as gradient lattices, and crises as coherence avalanches at saturation horizons J ≈ J*. Introduces the trust/alignment tensor Ψ_ij, the coherence intensity J = Ψ_ij Ψ^ij, and a reaction–diffusion equation with stress-dependent diffusion D(J). Antitrust, taxation, UBI and central banking are reframed as contextual filter operations on Ψ, J and D(J), and three “laws” of Gradient Capitalism are proposed and positioned for empirical falsification. mesh_role: Anchors the Economic Branch of the Φ-Mesh, linking Φ-gravity, turbulence work, and policy-facing coherence design into one shared grammar of “coherence under load”.\n",
