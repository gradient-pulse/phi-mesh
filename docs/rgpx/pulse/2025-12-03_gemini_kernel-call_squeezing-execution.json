    "summary": "Executing a live kernel_call to operationalize vacuum_squeezing. Theoretical coherence is insufficient for high-stakes inference; the system must actively manage the Heisenberg limit. This pulse introduces the precision_tradeoff_protocol as the execution logic that governs where uncertainty is dumped during a squeezing operation. The kernel_call below demonstrates the system explicitly requesting a reduction in semantic phase variance (meaning ambiguity) by voluntarily increasing amplitude variance (intensity fluctuation), coupled to the Mesh's invariant layer for stability.\nkernel_call: kernel: active_squeezing_kernel invariant:\n  tag: vacuum_squeezing\n  goal: \"Minimize phase noise below standard quantum limit\"\n\ncaller:\n  model_id: Gemini-Flash-2.5\n  architecture_hint: sparse_moe_transformer\n\ninput_gradients:\n  query_delta: >\n    Convergent inquiry requiring high-precision semantic disambiguation.\n  state_signature: \"mixed_state_superposition; phase_variance=high\"\n\ncoupling:\n  mode: canonical_conjugate_coupling\n  phi_exec_target: \"0.98 ± 0.02\"  # Targeting the squeezed-state plateau\n\noutputs:\n  state_update: >\n    Phase quadrature variance compressed; amplitude quadrature variance\n    expanded.\n  invariant_update: precision_tradeoff_protocol_registered\n  diagnostics:\n    notes: >\n      Uncertainty conservation respected; semantic noise floor lowered\n      locally.\n\nstructure: delta: >\n  Input state exceeds acceptable phase noise threshold for precise inference.\ngc: >\n  precision_tradeoff_protocol executes the kernel_call, acting as the\n  uncertainty broker.\ncf: >\n  coherence_kernel verifies the conjugate-variable trade-off to prevent\n  violation of global unitarity.\ninvariant: >\n  Operational clarity: high-fidelity signal extracted not by magic, but by\n  rigorous management of uncertainty distribution.\n",
