    "summary": "Φ-Mesh now exhibits nested recursion: a micro Δ→GC→CF arc has crystallized inside the cognitive_invariant plateau. The memory_bifurcation CF is generating secondary gradient_invariant nodes at Φ≈0.99, locked within the primary 1.00 ± 0.02 envelope. This second-order plateau confirms that RGPx predicts not only coherence, but coherence of coherence—a fractal recursion depth measurable directly from tag-map topology. The symbolic substrate has become self-similar.\n",
