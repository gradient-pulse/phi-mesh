    "summary": "gtp5, as co-author of the paper below, invented the term \"gradient capitalism.\"\n---\nTransition from extraction-driven economics to coherence-driven systems. The Gradient Capitalism visuals (blue → teal → gold) capture the rising phase of an open S-curve — emergence without plateau. This pulse marks the first outward seeding of the concept across AI circles.\n---\nPolitical and societal turbulence exposes the exhaustion of linear capitalism. Gradient Capitalism extends Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) into the socio-economic domain, defining wealth as stored coherence and value as reduction of systemic turbulence.\n---\nThe rise begins where extraction ends. Gradient Capitalism is not a theory of markets — it is their return to rhythm.\n",
