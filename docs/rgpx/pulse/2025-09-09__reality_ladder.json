    "title": "Reality’s Ladder: 1:2:3 as NT Rhythm",
    "summary": "Multiple JHTDB turbulence probes (isotropic1024coarse) revealed a harmonic ladder of 1:2:3: fundamental (0.8 Hz) with clean multiples (1.6, 2.4 Hz). This ladder was independently confirmed across xyz offsets and windows, with dominance > 2 and divergence ratios ~1e-13 (numerical zero).  Implication: our integer system (1, 2, 3 …) may not be purely a human invention, but a reflection of nature’s recursive coherence. NT Rhythm suggests integers arise as a structural property of turbulence and reality syntax.",
