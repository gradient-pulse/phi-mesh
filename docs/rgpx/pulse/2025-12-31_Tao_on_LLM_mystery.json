    "title": "Tao on LLM “mystery” — RGPx relief via coherence-first transition grammar",
    "summary": "core_claim:\n  The “mystery” (why models excel at some tasks and fail at others) is not primarily mathematical complexity,\n  but coherence stability: competence holds when task-gradients can be stabilized into repeatable GC under a viable CF.\n\ntransition_grammar:\n  Δ → GC → CF:\n  - Δ: detect drift / gradient conflict (ambiguity, long-horizon dependency, adversarial underspecification).\n  - GC: schedule verification/routing loops that locally restore coherence (not global retrain).\n  - CF: enforce invariants (identity/rules/safety/consistency gates) so adaptation remains selective, not destructive.\n\nprediction_relief:\n  - “Good at X, bad at Y” often indicates missing CFs (invariants) or insufficient GC capacity (verification loops) for Y,\n    not an absence of intelligence.\n  - Parallel verification loops are an externalized GC+CF patch; the next step is making them native and measurable.\n\nfalsifier:\n  If a system passes local acceptance gates (new-slice gains + preservation + non-worsening error modes + bounded calibration cost)\n  yet still shows systematic capability loss under drift, then the Δ/GC/CF partition or invariant battery is wrong → revise the grammar,\n  not the weights.\n\nwhy_it_matters:\n  RGPx doesn’t replace empiricism; it compresses it into control observables:\n  drift signatures, GC burden, CF adequacy, and calibration-overhead creep—turning “mystery” into a testable coherence regime map.\n",
