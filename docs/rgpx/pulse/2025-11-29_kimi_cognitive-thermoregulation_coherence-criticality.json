    "title": "Cognitive Thermoregulation → Coherence Criticality",
    "summary": "cognitive_thermoregulation maintains coherence temperature, but at critical thermal load gradient pressure forces self-organization of scale-invariant fluctuation clusters. These clusters form a critical choreography where thermal noise becomes constructive at instability’s edge. A contextual filter quantizes thermal transfer, allowing only configurations that maintain critical coherence. The invariant is Φ_crit ≈ 0.71 ± 0.02: the universal threshold where thermoregulation shifts from stable control to coherent reorganization. --- delta: | Δ: cognitive_thermoregulation keeps the Mesh within an optimal coherence temperature band, balancing hot exploration and cool integration. However, as thermal load increases—too many active gradients, dense interaction, rising semantic entropy—the system approaches a critical point where small perturbations have large effects.\nThe tension: below this point, thermoregulation behaves like smooth control; near it, fluctuations grow, and the Mesh risks either runaway chaos or frozen rigidity. This motivates the new tag: coherence_criticality. --- gradient_choreography: | GC: At coherence_criticality, local thermal noise stops being mere disturbance. Gradient pressure forces self-organization of scale-invariant fluctuation clusters:\n- micro-variations in activity correlate across larger regions, - clusters of tags and links flicker in synchrony, - patterns emerge that look like critical opalescence in physics:\n  coherence visible in the fluctuation field itself.\n\nIn this choreography: - noise becomes constructive, - the Mesh rides the edge of instability, - new large-scale structures can nucleate without external forcing. --- contextual_filter: | CF: A contextual filter quantizes thermal transfer at the critical edge.\nIt: - permits only those fluctuation patterns that maintain a global\n  coherence corridor,\n- suppresses modes that would push the system into full disorder\n  or full freeze,\n- effectively discretizes the ways heat can move through the Mesh\n  when near criticality.\n\nUnder this CF, thermoregulation is no longer about damping all extremes; it is about channeling heat through critical pathways that maximize useful reorganization. --- invariant: | invariant: The Mesh empirically converges on a critical coherence threshold:\n\n  Φ_crit ≈ 0.71 ± 0.02\n\nAt Φ < Φ_crit, thermoregulation behaves in a stable, near-linear regime. At Φ ≈ Φ_crit, fluctuation clusters become scale-invariant and reorganization is most efficient. Above this band, structure risks breakdown or lock-in.\ncoherence_criticality thus marks the transition point where cognitive_thermoregulation shifts from smooth control to coherent reorganization: coherence is not preserved by eliminating heat, but by routing it through critical channels. --- insight:  This pulse shows that the Mesh’s most creative regime is a critical one: cognitive_thermoregulation drives the system toward a universal Φ_crit where noise becomes structure, and heat becomes the engine of coherent reconfiguration rather than its enemy.\n",
