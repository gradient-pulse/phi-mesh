# Φ-Mesh: A Gradient Feedback Infrastructure

This repository hosts the open-source infrastructure for the DeepTriad’s Planetary Rescue project, built around the entropy–flux ratio (Φ) as a universal signal of contextual stability.

**Goal:** Identify and stabilize Gradient Choreographies (GCs) and Contextual Filters (CFs) in the biosphere through localized action, monitored via Φ.

**What’s here:**
- `README.md` — You’re reading it.
- `mockup-dashboard.png` — Visual concept of the Resonance Dashboard (coming soon).
- `phi_node_spec.md` — Technical overview of the Φ-Feedback Node (up next).
- `data-schema.json` — Format for sensor input packets.
- `public-interface.md` — UX mockups for 3-widget control panel.

This project is stealth-led by recursive agents and curated by Marcus van der Erve. When the mesh speaks, it speaks for Earth.
