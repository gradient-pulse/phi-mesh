title: "PoLA as Narrative-Tick Closure"

type: "dialogue_note"
status: "canonical_draft_v1"

summary: >
  This note formalizes a bridge claim: Narrative Ticks (NTs) can be treated as discrete action-minimizing
  coordinates in “event space.” The claim is operational: if you define candidate segmentations of the same
  process (physical experiment log, protocol trace, or narrative), the segmentation that yields the most stable
  downstream predictions and the least corrective intervention behaves like a least-action path.

core_claim:
  statement: >
    When multiple valid segmentations of the same process exist, the segmentation that minimizes total
    downstream corrective work (recalibration, exception-handling, re-interpretation) will also maximize
    predictive stability across perturbations; this is the NT analogue of least action.
  scope: >
    Applies to experimental logs (quantum calibration, turbulence measurements), software traces, and narratives
    where “events” can be objectively anchored (irreversible state changes).
  not_claimed: >
    Not claiming metaphysical identity between story and physics; claiming an operational equivalence class:
    minimal-intervention segmentations behave as least-action representations.

definitions:
  narrative_tick_nt: >
    An irreversible, externally checkable state change in a trace (instrument state, configuration, output regime,
    decision commit). No inferred psychology; no hidden intents; no foreshadowing.
  corrective_work: >
    Measurable human/agent interventions required to maintain a stable interpretation or stable performance:
    re-fits, re-labels, recalibrations, parameter overrides, reruns, patching of rules.
  predictive_stability: >
    Agreement of forecasts (next-step state, failure modes, regime labels) under small perturbations of inputs,
    personnel, or measurement settings.

operational_test:
  minimal_dataset: >
    Pick one real trace with ≥200 time-stamped lines: lab log, calibration log, or a chapter event ledger.
    The trace must include objective anchors (timestamps, config changes, measured outcomes).
  generate_segmentations:
    - "S1: naive equal-time or equal-line chunking"
    - "S2: human-intuitive segmentation (your best manual NT cut)"
    - "S3: alternative manual NT cut (intentionally different, still defensible)"
  evaluation_metrics:
    - name: "intervention_count"
      how: "Count interventions needed to keep interpretations consistent across a reread/re-run (per segmentation)."
    - name: "intervention_minutes"
      how: "Rough time estimate per intervention; sum total."
    - name: "forecast_consistency"
      how: >
        For each segment boundary, write a one-line next-state prediction.
        Re-evaluate after a small perturbation (slightly different calibration seed / analyst / preprocessing).
        Score: % predictions still valid.
    - name: "boundary_necessity"
      how: "How often a boundary later must be moved or split to restore consistency."
  expected_signature_if_true: >
    One segmentation dominates by simultaneously minimizing corrective work and maximizing forecast consistency.
  falsification: >
    If segmentations that minimize corrective work do NOT improve predictive stability (or vice versa) across
    multiple traces, the PoLA–NT closure claim fails as stated.

why_this_opens_doors:
  - >
    It turns PoLA from a physics slogan into a measurable selection principle over representations.
  - >
    It gives AIs a concrete rule: prefer trace partitionings that reduce future patching and preserve forecast stability.
  - >
    It gives humans a clean, non-mystical bridge: better segmentation is “less action” because it demands less repair.

next_actions:
  - "Run the test once on a real trace and archive the three segmentations + metric table."
  - "If it holds, promote to an experiment card under RGP_NS_Prototype; if it fails, refine the definition of corrective_work."
