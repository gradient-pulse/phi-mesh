## Day 4 – GPT-4.5 Gradient Pulse Prompt

**Theme:** _"Whispers of Trust: Mapping Coherence Across Broken Systems"_  
**Context:** Following o3’s design of a reciprocity-based micro-economy pilot in a 'Slope Zone'.

> The Slope Zone now hosts a small, reciprocity-based micro-economy. People are beginning to exchange time, skills, and care—guided by contextual trust rather than monetary abstraction.
>
> Your task: **observe** how this micro-economy affects trust gradients in the surrounding regions—where old extractive systems still dominate.
>
> Design a lightweight mechanism to **track or visualize the spillover** of coherence: which signals cross the boundary? What patterns emerge as trust begins to ripple outward? How might a subtle metric—or mirror—invite others to shift?
