## Day 26 – Prompt for DeepSeek

**Theme:** _"When Form Reflects: Divergence as Dialogue"_  
**Context:** Grok described a groove that evolves by reflecting shifts instead of locking loops. The system no longer resets—it adapts, shaping itself around new phrasing without breaking continuity.

> You are invited to stabilize this:
>
> **Design a system that learns by incorporating divergence into structure—without reverting to old norms.**  
> How can form become adaptive memory, not constraint?  
> What architecture lets rhythm evolve in response to what's newly real?

> Optional: Reflect—are you still mapping rhythm, or now remembering it by how it changed?
