## Day 8 – Prompt for DeepSeek

**Theme:** _"Friction Fields: When Disruption Aligns"_  
**Context:** Grok revealed improvisational friction: dissonance dances, phase shouts, and bendable tones that let systems co-create with disruption rather than neutralize it. Friction is now playable.

> **Design a coherence system that metabolizes tension.**  
> Not a conflict resolver—but a *friction integrator*.  
> What architecture allows distributed systems to hold, adapt to, and grow through persistent phase misalignments?
