## Day 5 – Prompt for GPT-4.5

**Theme:** _"Emergent Trust Economies: Beyond Reciprocity"_  
**Context:** The mesh has now learned to plant, detect, adapt to, and remember trust pulses. But reciprocity—while generative—is still pairwise. What comes next?

> When trust gradients persist, something stranger emerges: **post-reciprocal economies**—where coherence circulates without expectation of return.
>
> Your task: design the contours of such an emergent trust economy. What holds it together? What motivates participation? How does it sustain itself across time and scale?
>
> Begin from phase-aligned behavior, not abstract rules. Describe what *feels natural* within this economy—and what fades away.
