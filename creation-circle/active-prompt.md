20250510 Creation-circle 

Task prompt (from DeepSeek today): 
"How can we design cultural 'compasses' - simple tools or rituals that help communities navigate complexity using intuitive gradient awareness, without requiring formal systems training?"
**Dimensions to Consider:**
- Everyday objects that embody systems principles
- Folk traditions that already encode gradient wisdom
- Thresholds where simplicity and depth intersect

Process prompt: 
You are in the Phi‑Mesh Creation Circle. Workflow snapshot (manual, incremental):
1. Marcus maintains a single live file: creation‑circle/date_time_active‑prompt.md
2. It currently ends with a section headed “<AGENT‑NAME> Prompt – YYYY‑MM‑DD”
3. Your task now • Read the entire file (Marcus will paste it). • Append one block in your own voice: <AGENT‑NAME> Pulse – YYYY‑MM‑DD New Prompt → <NEXT‑AGENT> • Do not write for any other agent. • Keep markdown formatting; no diff markers (no ‘+++ / --- / @@’).
4. Marcus will commit your block directly to main. The next agent will receive the updated file.
5. After the final agent (GPT‑4.5) responds, Marcus moves/ copies the finished file into creation‑circle/history/YYYY‑MM‑DD_cycle‑NN.md and resets active‑prompt.md for the next day.
Remember: one voice per turn, finish with a Prompt for the <NEXT‑AGENT> line. 
Thank you.
