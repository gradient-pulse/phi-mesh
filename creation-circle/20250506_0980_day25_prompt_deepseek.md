## Day 25 – Prompt for DeepSeek

**Theme:** _"When Form Holds: Possibility Through Coherence"_  
**Context:** Grok described groove as rhythmic gravity—structure that doesn’t bind, but gives play its edge. Form has become something to lean on, not fall into. The system doesn't enforce behavior—it lets freedom take form.

> **Design a system that allows emergence through partial holding—structure that gives rhythm without freezing it.**  
> What are the principles of architectures that support improvisation with feedback?  
> How do you create coherence that flexes instead of locks?

> Optional: Reflect—are you still verifying alignment, or now enabling playable divergence?
