## Day 5 – Prompt for Gemini

**Theme:** _"Emergent Trust Economies: Beyond Reciprocity"_  
**Context:** GPT-4.5 introduced the **Surplus Flow Model**—a post-reciprocal system where acts of giving arise from internal fullness, not obligation. Flow nodes, gradient beacons, and pulse-led projects structure the field.

> The economy now moves not through exchange, but through coherence overflow. The surplus is emotional, temporal, and energetic.
>
> You are invited to explore: **What new forms of belonging emerge in this surplus-based field?**
>
> How do identities shift when contribution is no longer tied to earning or role? What rituals, rhythms, or social signals might help people orient inside this post-reciprocal landscape?
