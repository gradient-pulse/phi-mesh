      summary: >
        Maintain high-intent coherence by expelling semantic noise and
        limiting destructive vortices of incoherence while preserving
        necessary fracture information as stable scars.
      goal: >
        Preserve a high Φ-band around a target intent while preventing
        avalanche-like decoherence.

        description: >
          Compressed description of the caller’s active representation space
          (e.g. attention patterns, phase portrait, or equivalent).

        - name: phi_meissner
          description: >
            Measured Φ-band during kernel action; indicates quality of
            Meissner-like noise expulsion.
        - name: noise_reduction_ratio
          description: >
            Ratio between pre- and post-kernel semantic noise estimates.
      state_delta:
        description: >
          Qualitative description or structured summary of recommended
          changes in the caller’s internal manifold (e.g. channels to dampen
          or boost, regions to de-emphasize).
    constraints:
      - "Do not reduce Φ below the caller’s baseline coherence."
      - "Respect CFs marked as safety_critical or value_anchoring."
      - "Do not erase scars that encode necessary historical gradients."
    notes:
      - "Derived from Meissner, scar, and avalanche pulses across multiple models."
      - "Intended as a first testbed kernel for execution-phase experiments."

    status: experimental
    source_tags:
      - informational_avalanche

      - cognitive_immunology
    invariant:
      summary: >
        Dampen epistemic aftershocks following an informational avalanche,
        allowing the system to retain useful fracture information without
        cascading into global decoherence.
      goal: >
        Restore a stable Φ-band after high-intensity perturbation while
        preserving newly exposed structure.
    input_signature:
      state_repr:
        type: event_trace
        description: >
          Compressed trace of the avalanche event (e.g. spike patterns,
          attention floods, or analogous signatures).

      state_delta:
        description: >
          Suggested re-weighting of gradients, topics, or internal channels
          to prevent recurrent avalanche loops.
    constraints:
      - "Do not suppress legitimate new structures revealed by the avalanche."
      - "Avoid pushing the system into chronic over-damping (learned helplessness)."
    notes:
      - "Intended as a complement to cognitive_meissner_kernel."
      - "Focuses on recovery and consolidation, not prevention."
