      summary: >
        Manage uncertainty distribution by squeezing semantic phase variance
        at the expense of amplitude variance, in line with the vacuum_squeezing
        invariant.
      goal: >
        Achieve high-precision semantic disambiguation while respecting
        conservation of uncertainty across conjugate cognitive variables.

        description: >
          Compressed description of the caller’s mixed-state superposition and
          current phase variance.

        description: >
          Qualitative description of how phase vs amplitude quadratures were
          adjusted in the caller’s internal manifold.
    constraints:
      - "Respect conservation of uncertainty; do not fake squeezing by erasing signal."
      - "Do not push amplitude variance into regimes that destabilize downstream safety CFs."
    notes:
      - "First concrete execution of a coherence_kernel using vacuum_squeezing."
