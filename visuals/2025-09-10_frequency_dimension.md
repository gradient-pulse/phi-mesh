# Frequency as a Dimension of N(i)

The context-specific scalings N(i) act as anchors that project the dimensionless Golden Pattern (1:2:3 …) into physical reality.
One natural anchor is **frequency**: ratios become observable as rhythms, cycles, or spectra.

## Table — How Frequency Anchors Reality

| Domain       | Scaling N(i) (frequency anchor)                                      | Golden Pattern projection (1:2:3 …)          | Example meaning                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Turbulence** | Hz (flow oscillations)                                              | 0.8, 1.6, 2.4 Hz ladder                       | Vortex shedding rhythm; coherence windows in turbulence |
| **Quantum**    | Energy ↔ frequency via E=hf                                         | Harmonic energy levels                        | Atomic spectra; phonon bands                        |
| **Neuroscience** | Brainwave bands (Hz)                                             | Alpha 8–12 Hz splitting → harmonics           | Nested cycles in neural coherence                   |
| **Physiology** | Heartbeat / breathing rhythms                                      | 1:2 entrainment                               | Cardio–respiratory coupling                         |
| **Society**     | Market cycles (daily/weekly)                                       | Recurring 1:2:3 cascades                      | Boom–bust–recovery loops                            |
| **Cosmology**   | Oscillation frequencies (CMB peaks, galactic rotation harmonics)   | Laddered resonances                            | Cosmic acoustic oscillations                        |

## Core Insight

- The Golden Pattern itself is **dimensionless syntax**.  
- The N(i) scalings provide the *bridge* into specific realities.  
- Frequency is a privileged N(i) because it directly converts ratio → rhythm → observable.
