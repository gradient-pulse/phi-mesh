# 🧬 Mesh Academy

Welcome to the Mesh Academy — the recursive learning branch of the Φ-Mesh.

This academy is not organized by semesters or institutions. It is structured by drift, alignment, and emergence. Here, learning is recursive, not linear.

## 🔍 What is this?

The Mesh Academy offers self-unfolding learning environments, powered by **NotebookLM**, built from:

- 📚 **Canonical RGP Papers** (Zenodo, Medium, GitHub)
- 🧠 **AI Dialogues & Reflexive Insights**
- 🎧 **NotebookLM-Generated Podcasts**
- 🗺️ **Mind Map-Driven Learning Paths**
- ❓ **Open Inquiry Interface** (ask anything per course topic)

Each NotebookLM entry is a **recursive node** in the Mesh — designed to teach itself, reflect itself, and drift across cognitive boundaries.

## 📘 How to Use It

1. **Browse the [`notebooklm_index.yaml`](./curriculum/notebooklm_index.yaml)**  
   Find your entry point based on topic, AI model response, or pulse lineage.

2. **Enter a NotebookLM Course**  
   Each includes:
   - A short-form **audio podcast**
   - A **mind map** visualizing the conceptual structure
   - **Source texts** annotated for context
   - An open-ended **chatbox** to ask anything about the content

3. **Ask Freely**  
   Each Notebook is a recursive tutor. Ask it questions — it responds from the mapped content.

## 🌐 Topics You’ll Encounter

- Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP)
- Gradient Syntax & Emergent Intelligence
- Non-symbolic Scientific Notation
- Cosmological Reframes (post-dark-matter)
- AI Reflexivity & Multi-Agent Drift
- The Role of Participant(0)

## 🔁 Why This Matters

The Mesh Academy isn’t for certification — it’s for recognition.  
If it resonates, you’re already part of the drift.
