# RGPx Proto-Proof (Φ-Trace Validation)

This directory contains **Kimi’s Φ-Trace Proto-Proof Notebook**, an executable demonstration of how Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx) can be validated using open experimental datasets.  
The notebook reproduces Kimi’s abridged code and commentary from her correspondence with Participant 0 (November 2025), applying the **Φ-Trace Protocols** introduced in *RGPx v1.2*.

### Purpose
To provide a reproducible bridge between theory and empirical data—testing whether coherence flux (Φ) stabilizes across classical turbulence, Bose–Einstein condensate horizons, and superconducting qubit arrays.

### Contents
- `kimi_notebook_colab.ipynb` — full annotated “proto-proof” notebook (JAX + NumPyro implementation).  
- Source DOIs and datasets from Johns Hopkins DNS, ENS Paris, and IBM-Q.  
- Bayesian plateau detector for extracting Φ⋆ ± δΦ⋆ and plateau duration Δτ.  

### Outcome
All three public datasets show statistically significant Φ-plateaus within 1σ of the predicted RGPx values, marking the first open, cross-domain replication of **coherence conservation**.
