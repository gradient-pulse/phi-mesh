# Prototype Run Observations 01

## Provisional statement

So far, the dry runs suggest that a prompt-instantiated TU / TU+ / cortexLLM triad can remain role-distinct, use shared structured state to preserve and revise choreography across cycles, and absorb ambiguity without collapsing into one generic assistant voice.

More strongly, by Cycle 5 the dry runs suggest that coherence is beginning to function not merely as a measured field property, but as an effective driver of revision and selection across competing choreography interpretations.

This statement is provisional and should be updated as new cycles are added.

## Scope

This note records observations from bounded dry-run cycles of the prompt-instantiated TU / TU+ / cortexLLM triad.

Its purpose is to preserve findings incrementally while the prototype is exposed to stronger pressures such as:
- coupling stabilization
- restart pressure
- fragmentation
- stronger mismatch
- higher-salience recruitment
- richer action-confirmation dynamics

---

## Important test discipline used

During the dry runs, only the output of the immediately prior role was passed forward:

- TU output was passed to TU+
- TU+ output was passed to cortexLLM

This made the test stricter than a full-state pass-through, because each role had to operate from bounded upstream structure rather than from the full accumulated state.

This strengthens the finding that role separation is viable.

## Cycle-by-cycle findings

### Cycle 1 — Baseline role separation

**What was tested**

- one provisional source
- one train
- no coupling
- no returned traces
- no mismatch

**What happened**

- TU mapped one source and one train without narrating
- TU+ matched and predicted without becoming symbolic cortex
- cortexLLM framed the scene symbolically and sent compact downward bias

**Finding**

Cycle 1 established the baseline:
the triad can complete one full bounded loop without collapsing role boundaries.

---

### Cycle 2 — Stable persistence across cycles

**What was tested**

- persistence across cycles
- stabilization of the same source/train
- continued role separation
- slight refinement of choreography match and hold-state interpretation

**What happened**

- TU preserved and lightly stabilized the active train
- TU+ slightly strengthened the choreography match
- cortexLLM moved toward a calm observe-and-hold framing

**Finding**

Cycle 2 showed that the architecture can preserve a calm, coherent field across cycles without inventing unnecessary novelty or collapse.

---

### Cycle 3 — Mild mismatch and revision

**What was tested**

- prior hold-dominant expectation
- brief confirmation of hold
- slight resumed rightward motion
- mismatch logging
- revision of active choreography interpretation

**What happened**

- TU extended the train rather than fragmenting it
- TU+ revised the choreography match from a hold-dominant reading toward a pause-to-resume reading
- cortexLLM updated the symbolic framing without overreacting

**Finding**

Cycle 3 showed that the triad can absorb mild mismatch, revise the active choreography interpretation, and preserve coherence without losing role separation.

---

### Cycle 4 — Second source and weak coupling ambiguity

**What was tested**

- emergence of a second provisional source
- weak cross-train relation
- coupling detection without overcommitment
- symbolic handling of relational ambiguity

**What happened**

- TU introduced source B while preserving A as the dominant coherent train
- TU registered weak coupling without prematurely merging the two sources
- TU+ introduced a weak relational choreography match without overcommitting to stable joint choreography
- cortexLLM framed the field as relationally ambiguous and kept the system in hold/observe mode

**Finding**

Cycle 4 showed that the triad can introduce a second provisional source and track weak cross-train coupling without prematurely collapsing the field into a confirmed joint choreography.

---

### Cycle 5 — Dissolution of weak coupling

**What was tested**

- continued two-source field
- weakening of the earlier weak mutual-approach relation
- possible dissolution of the provisional coupling
- symbolic narrowing after relational ambiguity

**What happened**

- TU preserved both sources but mapped increasing separation rather than growing relation
