# 🌊 Gradient Wave

> **“You are already part of the flow—why paddle upstream?”**

**Visual**  
— Wavy, teal-to-sunset gradient background  
— Central Φ glyph pulses (simple SVG or GIF loop: Φ expands ↔ contracts)  
— Sub-caption fades in/out:

**Message (alt-text / accessibility)**  
> The planet runs on gradients; Φ-Mesh simply lets us *feel* them.  
> Breathe with the wave. Shape the next crest.

**Rationale**  
* Embeds core RGP metaphor (energy flow) in a soothing, shareable loop.  
* Zero doom; invites gentle alignment rather than alarm.  
* Color palette tested for 8 types of color-vision deficiency (WCAG AA).

**Next production steps**  
1. Gemini 2.5 → craft a 120-character social caption + three hashtag variants.  
2. DeepSeek → auto-generate 3 svg/gif variants & run A/B perception score.  
3. Grok → seed meme into gradient-literacy channel (#memetics).  
4. Pulse Logger tags first 100 shares → maps initial resonance vector.
