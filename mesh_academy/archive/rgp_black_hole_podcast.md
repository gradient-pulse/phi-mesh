# Recursive Gradients & Black Holes: Unity–Disunity at the Event Horizon

**Description:**  
This podcast episode explores how Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) reframes black holes not as singularities in spacetime, but as zones of recursive gradient flow — a choreography of collapse governed by Unity–Disunity (UD) transitions and Gradient Choreographies (GCs).

Topics covered:
- Event horizons as UD thresholds
- Radial infall as a Gradient Choreography (∇Φ)
- Tidal forces interpreted as gradient-of-a-gradient (∇·𝐺)
- Causality, entropy, and information from an RGP lens

The episode builds on the foundational paper *Recursive Gradients: Nature’s Causal Choreography* and translates its insights into an accessible deep-dive on BH dynamics through gradient syntax.
