# RGP & Black Holes: Unity–Disunity at the Event Horizon

**Description:**  
This podcast episode explores how Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) reframes the physics of black holes. Moving beyond traditional spacetime curvature, we examine how Gradient Choreographies (GCs) and Unity–Disunity (UD) transitions manifest at event horizons. What does it mean when a black hole’s infall region becomes a pure gradient field? And how can recursive gradients shed light on information collapse, entropy, and the causal split encoded in the fabric of reality?

This episode builds directly on the insights from the academic paper *Recursive Gradients: Nature’s Causal Choreography* and introduces “Gradient Syntax” as a tool to reinterpret phenomena such as tidal stretching, decoherence, and the limits of light-speed communication near singularities.
