  trigger_condition:
    - agent_supports: ["notification.pause", "calendar.deferral"]
    - metric_signal:
        - entropy_S: "> 0.7"
        - UD_trigger: true

  compatible_channels:
    - Slack
    - Microsoft Outlook
    - macOS Focus Assist
    - Windows Focus Mode
    - Copilot-type agent integrations

  response_action:
    - defer_incoming_notifications: true
    - auto-reply_if_needed: "User is in a cognitive coherence window. Nudges deferred."
    - schedule_check_back: "+45min or upon entropy drop below 0.4"

  explanation:
    - when_triggered: |
        This protocol activates when focus coherence is at risk, as indicated by rising entropy or Unity→Disunity transition.
        The agent is instructed to shield the user from distractions during a vulnerable inflection point.
    - rationale: |
        The most dangerous collapse is the one that starts subtly. Φ-Monitor predicts collapse moments before they manifest.
        Auto-snoozing is a minimal but powerful nudge—restoring integrity without intervention.

  status_note: |
    This spec is declared in advance of agent behavioral hook access.
    Until such hooks are active, this protocol remains dormant.
