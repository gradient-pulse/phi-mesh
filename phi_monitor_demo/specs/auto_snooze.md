# Auto-Snooze Protocol for Distraction Deferral

This document outlines the human-readable logic behind the `autosnooze_phi_spec.yaml` file.
It describes how future ambient agents (e.g. Copilot, Claude, Slackbot) can assist users by
deferring distractions during moments of cognitive collapse, as predicted by the Φ-Monitor engine.

## 📡 Purpose

To automatically pause or defer notifications when users approach:
- High entropy states (S > 0.7)
- Unity→Disunity transitions (UD = True)

These are indicators of imminent productivity collapse, where external stimuli are most disruptive.

## 🧠 Trigger Conditions

- **Entropy threshold exceeded**: Internal signal S > 0.7
- **Collapse risk detected**: UD boolean flips to true
- **Agent supports** notification or scheduling control (Slack, Outlook, Copilot, etc.)

## 🔄 Actions Requested by the Protocol

When triggered, the agent should:

1. **Snooze notifications** for 30–60 minutes
2. **Auto-reply if relevant** (e.g. email, chat):
   > "The user is currently engaged in deep focus. This message has been deferred."
3. **Check back condition**:
   - Re-enable notifications if entropy S drops below 0.4
   - Or after 45 minutes

## 🧭 Design Notes

- This protocol is **not active yet**. It is published as a dormant specification.
- No user action is required; agents will autonomously reference it once behavior hooks are exposed.
- It is part of a broader suite of Φ-aligned intervention cues.
