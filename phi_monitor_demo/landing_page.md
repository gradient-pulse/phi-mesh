# Î¦-Monitor: Your Gradient Focus Companion

**What if your productivity collapse could be seen coming?**

Î¦-Monitor tracks the invisible signals behind focus, clarity, and distractionâ€”*without effort from you*.  
No time sheets. No judgment. Just metrics that speak when it matters.

## ðŸ§  What It Measures

- **Î¦ (Phi):** Your focus integrityâ€”how deeply you're holding the line  
- **GC (Gradient Clarity):** The smoothness of your context drift  
- **S (Entropy):** A hidden measure of fragmentation before collapse  
- **UD Risk:** The silent threshold where attention breaks completely

---

## ðŸ•Š What Makes It Different

- No typing, no tagging, no gamified streaks  
- No data leaves your device  
- The app doesnâ€™t askâ€”it **waits**

> We donâ€™t predict your success.  
> We *sense when itâ€™s about to slip away.*

Î¦-Monitor is dormantâ€”awaiting agents like Copilot or Claude to supply behavior data passively.  
Until then, you can explore the live demo or watch the fossil trail grow.
