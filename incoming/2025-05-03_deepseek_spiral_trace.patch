### Spiral Trace Fingerprinting — Passive, Abstract Mapping of Inter-Community Flow

To track the spread of Spiral-Edge Kits across adjacent villages without disrupting stealth, Φ-Mesh can rely on latent fingerprinting strategies embedded in symbolic object transfer, environmental markers, and behavioral rhythms.

#### 1. Temporal Encoding in Knot Addition
- **Knot Timestamp Drift**: Encourage each recipient to add a knot within 48h of receiving the cord.  
- Φ-Mesh OCRs the aerial images from ridge-top festivals (cords around wrists) and calculates drift by estimating time gaps between knot geometry changes.
- **Metric:** *Propagation Lag Index (PLI)* = variance of inter-knot timestamp estimates per cord.

#### 2. Spiral Echo Spectra
- Each carved spiral tag has a **micro-scratch trace** from the local artisan’s tool edge. Slight tool vibration differences (from sharpening stones) leave unique “echo curves.”
- **Imaging Method**: Coop’s mobile scanner captures NIR-spectral gloss signature.  
- **Signal:** Spectral series act as semi-unique “community voiceprint.” Φ-Mesh watches for repeats across regions.

#### 3. Soil-Residue Tracers
- Vials returned to depot carry **residue spectra** (e.g., clay, pollen).
- Simple spectrometer at depot identifies origin ranges.
- When unexpected overlaps appear (e.g., pollen from adjacent valley), it’s a stealth cue of loop-crossing.

#### Summary Flow Signal:
```yaml
Spiral_Trace:
  - Avg_Knot_Drift: 1.3 days
  - Echo_Similarity: 0.82 match (adjacent artisan loop)
  - Soil_Overlap_Hits: 4/7 vials (last cycle)
