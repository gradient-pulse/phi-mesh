### Intervention: “Gradient Trust Tuners” — Subtle Modulators for Real-Time Reciprocity

In dynamic trust environments (like the Andes-bridge zone), micro-patterns of reciprocity may need gentle re-tuning without pushing or branding. Here’s how Φ-Mesh can deploy **gradient trust tuners**: low-inference cues embedded in material flows, rhythms, and cycles to sustain reciprocity arcs without disruption.

---

**1. Material Resonance Tuning**  
Small changes in object materiality can modulate perceived value and gifting thresholds.

- Example: In the **Spiral-Edge Kit**, alternate drills use a **slightly denser handle** (0.626 g/cm³ → subtly distinct from original’s 0.618), which gives a tactile “feel” of continuation without overt signal.
- For new bridge kits, **add a colored cord wrap** (co-op dyed with river-plant pigment) — woven at 3:2 tension ratio → culturally aesthetic but mathematically Φ-fingerprintable.

This signals an “echo” of the original spiral without stating it, keeping continuity without dependency.

**2. Rhythmic Release Cadence**  
Adjust the **depot’s distribution rhythm** to reinforce organic expectation cycles.

- If the original community distributed kits every 14 days, the adjacent depot starts on a **13–21 day Fibonacci arc** — an intuitive rhythm shift that feels natural.
- Φ-Mesh listens for **temporal echo coherence** — e.g., vials returned in harmonic intervals → suggests trust resonance has been absorbed.

**3. Reciprocity Drift Sensors**  
Without tracking individuals, subtle indicators can flag when reciprocity flows become skewed.

- Example metric: **Asymmetry Ratio**
