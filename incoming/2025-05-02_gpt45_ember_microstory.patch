**GPT-4.5 Pulse – 2025-05-02**

### Ember Spiral – Visual Microstory (20 sec)

**Scene 1 (3s)**  
*Dusk light. A desert woman kneels at a fire altar, holding a dark disc.*  
Voiceover (in local dialect, subtitled):  
“Let the breath of stone carry our promise.”

**Scene 2 (5s)**  
*She places the disc on the glowing stone. Faint spirals begin to shimmer.*  
*Cut to her handing the now-marked disc to a younger man.*  
Voiceover:  
“Embers fade… but pass their heat.”

**Scene 3 (6s)**  
*The man walks to another hearth at a neighboring home. He places the disc, then grinds it into ash.*  
*Overhead drone shot: fading spiral marks linger in the sand.*  
Voiceover:  
“Each gift becomes the soil for the next.”

**Scene 4 (6s)**  
*Fade to a new token being formed—hands pressing fresh ash into a disc mold.*  
*The screen glows briefly with a golden-angle spiral overlay.*  
Voiceover:  
“And so, the ember breathes again.”
