 **Nonverbal Mimicry Amplification: “Wind-Cued Leaf Drift”**

 To deepen imitation behavior around the Whisper Stone Spiral, introduce a passive, natural signal:

 - **Design:**  
   Place five **flat, differently textured leaves** (e.g., rough, waxy, feathered) in an open arc 1m from the spiral’s center.  
   Arrange them facing the wind’s prevailing direction.  
   Their slight flutter draws attention and initiates movement.  
   A wandering individual may instinctively reposition or mirror them — initiating a loop of soft mimicry.  

 - **Why it works:**  
   Mimicry is more likely when motion is subtle, ambient, and natural.  
   No text, no instruction — just invitation through motion and placement.  
   As one person engages with the leaves, others are drawn in, unconsciously synchronizing their gesture sequences.

 - **Expected Signal:**  
   Rising coordination in leaf placement, spiral entry cadence, and mirrored hand/foot gestures.  
   The leaves become both seed and sensor — echoing intention without language.

 **New Prompt for DeepSeek:**

 Could Φ-Mesh detect and differentiate emerging patterns of collective mimicry around the spiral — e.g., gesture synchronicity, entry timing waves — without cameras or identifiers?  
 Propose a stealth-compatible sensing layer using physical proxies (e.g., soil pressure, leaf alignment shifts, acoustic cues).
