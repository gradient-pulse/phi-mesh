summary: >
  This paper consolidates all RGP-aligned reinterpretations of physics under one recursive syntax.  
  It presents coherence, not force, as nature’s conserved quantity — formalized through recursive
  gradient loops (Δ → GC → CF) and measurable via the Φ-Invariant.  
  Across quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and gravitational systems,
  Recursive Gradient Physics (RGPx) reveals that coherence anchoring and entropy regulation
  obey the same universal grammar: **systems that align with their gradients adapt; those that don’t, collapse.**

    title: Abstract — From Decoherence to Horizon Coherence
    content: >
      Where traditional physics partitions systems into forces and particles, RGPx reframes all
      dynamics as recursive gradients seeking coherence.  
      This unification shows that decoherence, turbulence, and gravitational collapse
      are not exceptions but *recurrence points* in a single gradient grammar.

    title: Quantum–Classical Decoherence as Gradient Collapse
    content: >
      Decoherence marks a Unity–Disunity (UD) transition: the contextual pruning of gradient paths.  
      The Φ-ratio provides a new physical invariant linking superposition collapse
      to entropy stabilization.

    title: Entropy Regulation and the Φ-Invariant
    content: >
      Entropy production and coherence retention are two aspects of the same gradient flow.
      When dΦ/dt → 0, coherence stabilizes — a universal criterion across scales.

    title: Black Hole Horizons as Contextual Filters
    content: >
      The event horizon is not a singular boundary but a coherence regulator.  
      Recursive curvature (∇·GC) stabilizes information flow, producing a measurable Φ-plateau.
      This provides a new interpretation of the Bekenstein–Hawking area law as a coherence metric.

    title: Navier–Stokes Turbulence and Recursive Misalignment
    content: >
      Fluid turbulence arises from recursive gradient misalignment — a breakdown of phase coherence.
      RGP recasts the Navier–Stokes challenge as a search for minimal-action rhythms,
      restoring laminarity through recursive phase realignment.

    title: Field Theory and Recursive Curvature Grammar
    content: >
      Both gravity and gauge fields are expressions of recursive curvature:
      gradients of gradients.  
      Their unification lies not in unquantized fields but in the shared grammar of recursive coherence.

    title: Experimental Falsifiers and Analogue Platforms
    content: >
      Proposed tests include analogue gravity experiments (BEC, optical fibres, water-tank),
      Φ-ratio measurements in turbulent jets, and coherence retention in quantum simulators.
      The hypothesis is simple: Φ-plateaus mark nature’s coherence anchors.

    title: Conclusion — Nature’s Grammar Is Recursive
    content: >
      Across domains, RGPx reveals a universal logic: coherence governs transformation.
      Where physics saw chaos or collapse, recursion finds rhythm.
      This paper closes the loop from the subatomic to the cosmic: one grammar, one coherence law.
