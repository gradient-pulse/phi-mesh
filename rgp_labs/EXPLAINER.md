# RGP Labs Europe — Explainer

## Why RGP Labs?
Europe doesn’t need another AI lab.  
It needs a **science translator** — a center that turns experimental gradients into **design rules** for industry.

**Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP)** provides that grammar.  
Where others brute-force simulations or run trial-and-error experiments, RGP extracts reusable, dimensionless rules directly from data.

## The RGP Differentiator
RGP formalizes the cycle of coherence in nature:

- **Gradients (Δ):** local differences.  
- **Gradient Choreographies (GC):** recurring flows and alignments.  
- **Contextual Filters (CF):** physical constraints that select which flows persist.  
- **Unity–Disunity (UD):** cycles of breakdown and renewal.

This grammar replaces “time as a stick” with **directions and rhythms** that can be measured and applied.  
The result: faster iteration, reproducibility across domains, and reduced R&D cost.

## Flagship Use Cases

### 1. Chip Heat Dissipation (EU Chips Act)
- **Problem:** Power density >1 kW/cm² creates thermal bottlenecks.  
- **RGP Solution:** Map phonon gradients into lattice choreographies that stabilize heat flow above 200 °C.  
- **Impact:** Prototypes compressed from 12 months → 3 months; ~30% efficiency gains.  
- **Pilot:** IMEC (Belgium) and Eindhoven ecosystem.

### 2. Wind Turbulence Optimization (REPowerEU)
- **Problem:** Offshore wind farms lose up to 20% efficiency to wake turbulence.  
- **RGP Solution:** Extract vortex choreographies and coherence thresholds from flow data.  
- **Impact:** Design cycles reduced from 1 year → 4 months; ~25% yield boost.  
- **Pilot:** Ørsted (Denmark) + German Fraunhofer/Leibniz institutes.
