descriptions:
  RGP: >
    Recursive Gradient Processing: a three-stage loop—
    Contextual Filter → Gradient Choreography → Unity/Disunity reset—
    that steers systems by minimizing divergence across steps.

  "NT (Narrative_Tick)": >
    The minimal, discrete step in a process’ rhythm: a measurable “beat” that
    advances state while preserving least-divergence structure.

  NT_rhythm: >
    The characteristic distribution of NT spacings (ratios and recurrences)
    observed when a system follows least-divergence dynamics.

  Contextual_Filter: >
    A selective gate that conditions inputs before composition.
    In RGP, CF stabilizes context so gradient choreography can cohere.

  Gradient_Syntax: >
    Stable patterns in how gradients combine, cancel, or amplify—akin to grammar
    for flows. It’s the structure that precedes polished form.

  Navier_Stokes: >
    Classical fluid PDEs; here reframed via RGP as gradient choreography rather than
    force-first integration, emphasizing coherence over brute stepping.

  turbulence: >
    Not mere disorder: an energetic regime where coherence can hide in ratios,
    harmonics, and recurrences—often a prelude to new laminarity.

  Rhythm: >
    The perceived regularity that emerges from repeating NT relations—humans
    feel it; systems conserve it when minimizing divergence.

  PoLA: >
    Principle of Least Action reinterpreted as “rhythm of least divergence”:
    solutions prefer sequences that conserve structure over time.

  ExperimenterPulse: >
    A compact report (human or agent) that links data, summary, and sources
    to a tag constellation; meant to be reproducible and comparable.

  Phi-monitor: >
    Ambient observer/agent that logs coherence signals and NT drift in the Mesh.

  AI_architectures: >
    Models and patterns (e.g., MoE) that echo RGP’s loop at silicon scale:
    routing (CF), expert execution (GC), and merge (UD reset).
