  RGP: "Recursive Gradient Processing — coherence emerges from recursive filtering, gradient choreography, and unity–disunity resets."
  "NT (Narrative_Tick)": "Discrete ‘ticks’ where a system’s story advances; small coherence jumps that replace continuous, field-like time."
  NT_rhythm: "The measurable cadence of Narrative Ticks; conserved timing pattern observed across cognition and physics."
  Rhythm: "Coherent timing structure that systems settle into under least-divergence pressure; backbone of stable behaviors."
  Contextual_Filter: "Selective lens that gates signals pre-processing; stabilizes coherence but can hide underlying gradients."
  Gradient_Syntax: "The ‘grammar’ of gradients — how signals compose across scales to form durable, reusable structure."
  Navier_Stokes: "Fluid dynamics reframed via RGP; we prioritize conserved NT rhythms over closed-form solutions."
  turbulence: "Not just noise: a canvas where NT rhythms can be detected; integrate instead of suppress."
  ExperimenterPulse: "Auto- or hand-authored notes that attach evidence to tags (papers, podcasts, stats) — the map’s living memory."
  unity-disunity: "Healthy oscillation between integrating and separating signals; a reset that prevents lock-in."
