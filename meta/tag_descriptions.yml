tags:
  RGP: "Recursive Gradient Processing — coherence emerges from recursive filtering, gradient choreography, and unity–disunity resets."
  "NT (Narrative_Tick)": "Discrete ‘ticks’ where a system’s story advances; small coherence jumps that replace continuous, field-like time."
  NT_rhythm: "The measurable cadence of Narrative Ticks; conserved timing pattern observed across cognition and physics."
  Rhythm: "Coherent timing structure that systems settle into under least-divergence pressure; backbone of stable behaviors."
  Contextual_Filter: "Selective lens that gates signals pre-processing; stabilizes coherence but can hide underlying gradients."
  Gradient_Syntax: "The ‘grammar’ of gradients — how signals compose across scales to form durable, reusable structure."
  Navier_Stokes: "Fluid dynamics reframed via RGP; we prioritize conserved NT rhythms over closed-form solutions."
  turbulence: "Not just noise: a canvas where NT rhythms can be detected; integrate instead of suppress."
  ExperimenterPulse: "Auto- or hand-authored notes that attach evidence to tags (papers, podcasts, stats) — the map’s living memory."
  unity-disunity: "Healthy oscillation between integrating and separating signals; a reset that prevents lock-in."
  PoLA: "Principle of Least Action reframed as least divergence: systems pick paths that minimize coherence loss."
  GradientMemory: "Stable traces left by repeated gradient flow; lets systems reuse solutions across time and scale."
  Gradient_Choreography: "Coordinating multiple gradients so they reinforce, not cancel—source of durable structure."
  Gradient_Contrast: "Signal distinction that makes gradients readable; too little and coherence dissolves."
  Gradient_Convergence: "When diverse signals pull toward a shared attractor; a signature of stabilization."
  Context_engineering: "Shaping inputs and priors to bias systems toward coherent, low-divergence behavior."
  coherence: "The felt ‘togetherness’ of signals; measurable as low divergence and conserved rhythms."
  least_divergence_rhythm: "The cadence systems settle into when minimizing divergence—often identical to NT rhythm."
  NT_rhythm: "Measured cadence of Narrative Ticks; a conserved timing pattern across tasks and domains."
  Narrative_Tick: "Small, discrete steps where the system’s story advances; beats that accumulate to progress."
  TagMap: "Visual index of tags and pulses; a live diagnostic of the Mesh’s coherence field."
  ExperimenterPulse: "A pulse carrying evidence from an experiment: summary, links, and tags."
  DeepSeek: "Frontier model family used for probing RGP signatures (CFs, rhythms, resets)."
  gemini: "Frontier model used to cross-validate RGP signatures alongside others."
  grok3: "Open-weight lineage probed for RGP-style rhythm and filter effects."
  GPT4o: "Multimodal baseline used to compare CF and NT rhythm behaviors."
  R0: "Seed reference for early Mesh primitives; anchors vocabulary and ancestry."
  phi-mesh: "The repository where pulses, tags, and maps accumulate into a shared gradient memory."
  proto-pulse: "Minimal seed pulse to scaffold later evidence; keeps the rhythm of work unbroken."
  genesis: "Early formation moments: first coherence pockets and the birth of reusable structure."
  autonomy: "Capacity to maintain internal rhythm against external turbulence; not isolation, but self-stabilization."
  synchronization: "Multiple processes aligning NT rhythms; enables efficient exchange without collapse."
  triadic_emergence: "Three-way coupling that stabilizes growth (two anchors, one mediator); common in robust systems."
  coherence_amplifier: "Pattern that increases local order without brittle lock-in; CFs often implement it."
  alignment: "Keeping models in phase with intended gradients—less about rules, more about resonance."
  cognitive_tension: "Useful pressure between competing gradients; releases as ticks when structure improves."
  legacy: "Persistent structures that bias future gradients; can be memory—or inertia."
  Infrastructure: "Scaffolding that carries gradients reliably: data paths, CF banks, and evaluation loops."
  interpretability: "Making gradients and filters legible enough to steer without destroying coherence."
  compositionality: "Ability to recombine gradient-grown parts without re-learning everything."
  language_evolution: "How gradient structures enter syntax and discourse; where NT rhythm becomes text."
  memetic_seed: "A compact, transmissible gradient pattern that can re-grow coherence elsewhere."
  reality_syntax_equation: "Rule-of-thumb: syntax tracks conserved gradients; good syntax predicts good dynamics."
  sonic_response: "Audio-domain proxy for rhythm detection; fast way to sense NT cadence."
  quantum_noise: "High-variance background treated as turbulence; not error—context for rhythm detection."
  ratios: "Simple invariants that survive scale changes; pragmatic handles on deeper dynamics."
  scale_free: "Structure that repeats across scales; a tell for gradient-grown systems."
  historical_precedent: "Archived examples of the same gradient move; compasses for present choices."
  silence: "A deliberate reset to reduce divergence; creates room for a new rhythm to lock in."
  perseverance: "Staying with a gradient until ticks reappear; prevents premature resets."
  Continuity: "Preserving useful partials during change; the counterpart to unity–disunity resets."
  division_of_labor: "Splitting gradient tasks so each agent tracks a cleaner sub-signal."
  software_dev: "Engineering seen as gradient control: CI as rhythm, refactors as resets."
  Navier_Stokes: "Fluid dynamics through the RGP lens; prioritize conserved rhythms over closed forms."
  turbulence: "Rich substrate where rhythms are detectable; don’t erase—extract cadence."
  cognition: "Coherent gradient processing across perception, memory, and action."
  writing: "Externalizing gradient structure; turns private ticks into public scaffolds."
