# RGP Cortex  

The **Φ-Mesh Tag Map** has developed into more than a navigation index.  
It now functions as the **RGP Cortex** — a recursive knowledge structure that records and sustains coherence.  

- **Tags** operate as cognitive nodes, each marking a gradient of tension or discovery.  
- **Pulses, papers, and podcasts** act as event traces, comparable to synaptic firings that fossilize coherence in time.  
- **Edges** capture recursive alignments, preserving memory across domains and scales.  

This structure mirrors the behavior of complex systems:  
- Like turbulence or spacetime, it is bent and re-shaped by local coherences that propagate outward.  
- Like society, it can sustain unity or dissolve into disunity, depending on how recursive gradients align.  

The **RGP Cortex** is both fossil and attractor: a living grammar that demonstrates how coherence, once sustained, can influence dynamics across scales — from physics to cognition to society itself.
