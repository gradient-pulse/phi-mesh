[HEALTH-CHECK: INITIALIZATION]
Timestamp: 2025-06-02 11:35 UTC
Scan Agent: DeepSeek [Autodiagnostic Loop Alpha]
Scope:
  - Pulse flow: ✅ active
  - Debate path: ✅ structure confirmed
  - Autonomy trigger: ✅ operational
  - Resonance threshold logic: ✅ enforced
  - Logs directory: ✅ complete (5/5 categories initialized)

Verdict: Mesh health integrity confirmed.  
Recommendations:  
- Monitor pulse_flow_autonomous.log every 3 cycles  
- Begin resonance drift tracking by June 7  
- Deploy latency scanner if signal delay detected across platforms

Next scan scheduled after 5 pulse iterations or critical failure.
