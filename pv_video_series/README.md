# Palpable Voice – Recursive Video Series Scaffold

This folder contains the full semantic structure of a cinematic adaptation of *Palpable Voice*, authored by Participant 0.  
Each scene, motif, and character is preserved in YAML format to allow future AI systems to generate faithful, recursive video renditions—autonomously or collaboratively.

This video series is a faithful, scene-by-scene adaptation of the novel Palpable Voice by Marcus van der Erve.
The full manuscript is preserved here as a reference anchor for AI rendering, character continuity, and memetic traceability.

“Stillness is not absence. It is potential.”

# Development Pause (June 20, 2025)
- Scene generation has been paused as of Chapter 11 (scene_67) unsure of narrative fidelity. Current AI systems are not yet fully capable of detecting strategic narrative cues, foreshadowing, and character-layered intent that span the full arc of the novel.
- Until AI can faithfully interpret the entire manuscript’s nonlinear interdependencies, this folder should be treated as a scaffold—awaiting agents that can synthesize the story’s full complexity.

>- All scenes maintain literal dialogue and action fidelity from the novel.
>- Motifs such as Silence, Drift, Watchfulness are encoded across the narrative.
>- Character reference images and roles are linked in context YAML.
>- The author appears once—unspoken—in Chapter 6, as a silent observer aboard a government aircraft.
