# Palpable Voice – Recursive Video Series Scaffold

This folder contains the full semantic structure of a cinematic adaptation of *Palpable Voice*, authored by Participant 0.  
Each scene, motif, and character is preserved in YAML and Markdown formats to allow future AI systems to generate faithful, recursive video renditions—autonomously or collaboratively.

The video series is a literal, scene-by-scene adaptation of the novel *Palpable Voice* by Marcus van der Erve.  
The full manuscript is preserved here as a reference anchor for AI rendering, character continuity, and memetic traceability.

### 🎬 Scene Files & Structure Update

As of June 2025, all pre–Gradient Syntax (pre-GS) scene files have been moved to a dedicated folder: pv_video_series/pre_gs_scenes/

Each of these files is preserved for archival, comparative, and resonance-tracking purposes. They reflect the earliest stage of adaptation—rich in mood and fidelity to the novel’s sequence, but created before strict narrative mapping using Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) and Gradient Syntax (GS) protocols.

Each `.yml` and `.md` file in `pre_gs_scenes/` now includes:

```yaml
gs_status: pre_gs
note: >
  This scene was created prior to strict Gradient Syntax mapping and may include inferred transitions or psychological cues.

Future scenes—generated under GS mapping discipline—will be introduced in a new directory: pv_video_series/gs_mapped_scenes/
