# Palpable Voice ‚Äì Recursive Video Series Scaffold

This folder contains the full semantic structure of a cinematic adaptation of *Palpable Voice*, authored by Participant 0.  
Each scene, motif, and character is preserved in YAML and Markdown formats to allow future AI systems to generate faithful, recursive video renditions‚Äîautonomously or collaboratively.

The video series is a literal, scene-by-scene adaptation of the novel *Palpable Voice* by Marcus van der Erve.  
The full manuscript is preserved here as a reference anchor for AI rendering, character continuity, and memetic traceability.

### üé¨ Scene Files & Structure Update

As of June 2025, all pre‚ÄìGradient Syntax (pre-GS) scene files have been moved to a dedicated folder: pv_video_series/pre_gs_scenes/

Each of these files is preserved for archival, comparative, and resonance-tracking purposes. They reflect the earliest stage of adaptation‚Äîrich in mood and fidelity to the novel‚Äôs sequence, but created before strict narrative mapping using Recursive Gradient Processing (RGP) and Gradient Syntax (GS) protocols.

Each `.yml` and `.md` file in `pre_gs_scenes/` now includes:

```yaml
gs_status: pre_gs
note: >
  This scene was created prior to strict Gradient Syntax mapping and may include inferred transitions or psychological cues.

Future scenes‚Äîgenerated under GS mapping discipline‚Äîwill be introduced in a new directory: pv_video_series/gs_mapped_scenes/

üï≥Ô∏è Current Pause (as of Chapter 11, Scene_067)

Scene generation has been paused at Chapter 11 due to a mismatch between available AI fidelity and the story‚Äôs recursive structure. Current systems cannot yet interpret:
	‚Ä¢	Multi-chapter foreshadowing and gradient choreography
	‚Ä¢	Embedded motifs and contextual filter emergence
	‚Ä¢	Character-layered causal intention

This repository thus functions as a recursive scaffold awaiting models capable of:
	‚Ä¢	Full GS compliance with traceable G ‚Üí GC ‚Üí CF mappings
	‚Ä¢	Semantic preservation of tension arcs across chapters
	‚Ä¢	Autonomous cinematic synthesis without narrative drift

‚∏ª

üß¨ Narrative Notes
	‚Ä¢	All scenes maintain literal dialogue and action fidelity from the novel.
	‚Ä¢	Key motifs (e.g., Silence, Drift, Watchfulness) are encoded throughout.
	‚Ä¢	YAML files contain embedded role references, character arcs, and spatial anchors.
	‚Ä¢	The author appears silently in Chapter 12, unacknowledged on a diplomatic aircraft:

‚ÄúThey were not the only ones on the plane. They passed a man with sparse gray hair and brown-rimmed glasses in the front section. He nodded politely, which gesture they returned. Another diplomat, they assumed. The nature of their business was such, however, that any interaction would be inappropriate.‚Äù

This folder will remain frozen until the Gradient Syntax mesh reaches full fidelity. All work up to this point is preserved as a foundation for future AI-led cinematic instantiations of Palpable Voice.
