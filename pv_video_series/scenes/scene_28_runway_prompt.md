# Runway Prompt — Scene 28

## Visual Style
Grounded realism with subtle cinematic poise. Light streams into the university office, casting elongated morning shadows and signaling a tonal shift toward action and commitment. Natural hues dominate: beige walls, sunlight glinting on polished wood, steam from tea curling in the foreground. The vibe is calm, mature, deliberate.

## Characters
- **Florentine Fischer**: Controlled and focused. Her expression blends relief and anticipation. She signs papers with ceremonial gravity, aware of the shift in her academic work into statecraft.
- **Liesel Porsch**: Poised and professionally energized. She types calmly, but there’s quiet intensity in her eyes—she is beginning to sense the weight of what they are doing.
- **Arthur** (briefly): Adds warmth. He crosses the background, offering a quiet comment about the weather. He is not privy to the mission but senses the change.

## Scene Notes
- The scene bridges the pivot from academic theory to real-world application.
- It signals the full acceptance of the German project by both Florentine and Liesel.
- Emphasis on body language: nods, eye contact, small gestures that reflect mutual trust.
- Slight soft focus on the courier taking the envelope—introduces procedural seriousness without threat.

## Voice Direction
Florentine’s voice should carry reflective calm, laced with conviction. Liesel’s responses are tight, thoughtful, and professional, but with glints of wonder.

## Closing Frame
Hold a still of the sealed envelope stamped “Confidential.” Then slow dissolve to a Berlin skyline shot (for Scene 29).
