narrative_function: >
  This is a turning point scene where the German government aligns itself with the AI-driven societal model.
  The Unity–Disunity model is now a legitimate national policy blueprint. Tensions emerge quietly, suggesting
  internal resistance. The renaming to "Projekt Goethe" roots the initiative in cultural and philosophical heritage,
  anchoring it in collective German identity while amplifying its forward-looking mandate.

  Cinematic realism with bureaucratic cool tones — steel, glass, and institutional lighting. Facial reactions and
  digital overlays (GenAI feedback) punctuate key emotional beats. Subtle music swells as Florentine hits peak
  moments in her talk; silence when GenAI intervenes. Framing mimics a high-stakes diplomatic session.
