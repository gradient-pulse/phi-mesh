title: The Codename Trap
chapter_ref: Chapter 7
location: Florentine’s office, UCL – followed by her walk to Russell Square Gardens
time: Late morning, sunny London

characters:
	•	Florentine Fischer
	•	Dr. Weber (voice only)
	•	GenAI interface (off-screen)

summary:
Florentine continues her phone conversation with Dr. Weber and proposes a counter-intelligence method using distinct historical codenames for each project contact. She tests the idea live by prompting GenAI to generate options. The strategy is approved, and an NDA addendum is discussed. After the call, Florentine leaves her office for a reflective walk through Russell Square Gardens, mulling over ethical concerns and project implications.

visual_style:
Blend of interior (cool natural light through blinds, slightly warm tungsten glow from desk lamp) and exterior (soft-focus green, light movement from breeze). The camera should alternate between Florentine’s expressions during the call and close-ups of her typing with GenAI. Exterior shots should evoke lightness and momentary clarity. Maintain narrative tension with understated movements and transitions.

sound_design:
Subtle office ambiance—low HVAC hum, muted footsteps, distant phones. During walk: birds, faint city traffic, occasional wind through leaves. Emphasize silence between internal thoughts.

camera_notes:
	•	Close-ups of Florentine’s face as she thinks and types
	•	Over-the-shoulder GenAI interface view
	•	Wide shot as she leaves the building
	•	Tracking shot as she walks into Russell Square Gardens
	•	Cutaways to her notebook page (“Gutenberg project”) on desk

dramatic_purpose:
To introduce a low-key spy mechanism inside a sociotechnical drama. Establish Florentine’s growing role as strategic operator. Her balance of trust, tact, and ethics becomes a critical pivot in the larger plot.
