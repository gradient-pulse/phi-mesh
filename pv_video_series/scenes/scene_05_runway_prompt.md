**Visual Description Prompt for Runway**

A multi-location composite scene begins in Florentine Fischer’s office at UCL. She receives a disturbing call from her stepdaughter Candace about an accusatory newspaper article. Include: warm desk lighting, academic clutter, and a digital news headline on screen: *"UK Civil War? First-Class Speaker Narrowly Escapes Somerset Bombing"*.

Cut to: Geoffrey Hargreaves and Ethan Parker entering her office—both in professional attire. Quick cuts of legal notes, PR printouts, and a visible triangular tattoo sketch on Florentine’s notepad. Emphasize calm, procedural urgency.

Shift to: BBC Broadcasting House in early evening. Zoom into a protest crowd with hand-painted signs. Inside the BBC studio, lighting rigs beam down on a tense interview setup. Kira Meloni gestures with interview notes while Florentine responds.

Sudden disruption: a young woman charges the set, baring painted protest words *"IN-QUALITY"* on her torso. Brief chaotic moment before security intervenes. Meloni quips, “Those are the naked facts,” returning to calm professionalism.

Final montage: Ollie Blackwood in the Herald’s newsroom, visibly anxious, scrolling on his screen. Fletcher’s office. A printed legal letter from UCL is placed on the desk. The golden retriever Sep watches. Closing shot: Ollie silently nodding, aware he’s at a crossroads.

**Tone and Style Notes**
- Balance institutional stillness (UCL, BBC) with sharp disruptions (protest, media backlash).
- Use tight framing for intimate moments (Florentine’s expression) and wide angles to depict power dynamics (BBC stage, newsroom).
- Lighting contrast: cool daylight in offices, warm tungsten in interview, harsh fluorescence in newsroom.
- Add flickers of digital life—laptop screens, alert banners, news tickers.

**Audio Notes**
- Muffled newsroom chatter, printer sounds
- Public protest chant fading into studio quiet
- Broadcast tone music with brief static intercut
- Meloni’s voice calm, then candid: “Those are the naked facts.”
- Candace’s early call echoes as motif: “Mom, you’re in the news… and not in a good way.”

This is the crescendo of public exposure and personal endurance. Render both the fracture and the poise.
