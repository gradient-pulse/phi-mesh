## Runway Prompt – Scene 064: Florentine's Opening Address

**Setting**: Chancellor’s Office, Berlin – Grand Conference Hall  
**Time**: Wednesday morning, shortly after the Chancellor’s surprise introduction  
**Tone**: Historic, poised, intellectually charged  
**Cinematic Style**: Verité + composed wide shots + emotionally timed pull-ins

### Description:
Florentine rises from her seat at the front of the Chancellor’s grand conference hall. The audience—a hand-picked assembly of ministers, strategists, and executive staff—sits in focused silence. Moments earlier, the Chancellor’s personal introduction stunned even senior officials. The air still vibrates with that gravity.

Behind Florentine, a projection appears: “Navigating Societal Unity–Disunity.” She begins calmly, acknowledging the unexpected honor of being welcomed here—not at a Ministry, but the nerve center of national strategy. Her speech traces the contours of a society stretched between coherence and fracture. She introduces pulse-based governance and AI not as overseer, but as empathic sensor, real-time integrator, and narrative weaver.

She allows space for glances, reactions, and GenAI summaries—handled live by Liesel and shared selectively with attendees. Her final statement hangs in the air:  
**“What kind of society do you believe can remain stable without recalibrating itself in real time?”**
