**Time:** Afternoon

## Scene Context
Florentine Fischer has just delivered a powerful keynote on the unity–disunity paradox and AI's potential role in guiding society. She now sits among Eastern European delegates at a lunch table during the international conference. As a subtle counterpoint to the serious geopolitical dialogue, a folded handwritten note arrives—an emotional gesture from Lada Morozov that pierces the tension.

## Visual Style Guidance
- **Setting:** Belle Époque dining hall, soft sunlight streaming through tall windows.
- **Mood:** Diplomatic but hushed; post-keynote reflections; subdued tension.
- **Florentine:** Poised, responsive but somewhat distant, processing both her talk and its reception.
- **Delegates:** In formal attire, animated in discussion about counter-disinformation measures.
- **Waiter:** Moves quietly between tables, delivers note with subtle deference.
- **Note Close-up:** Emotional weight in small gestures—Florentine’s hand hesitating before unfolding the note; her faint, private smile.

## Key Visual Moments
- Mid-conversation, the waiter steps behind Florentine and discreetly hands her a folded note.
- Cutaway to the note’s contents in her hand: “Dear Florentine, Thank you so much! Your speech will stay with me forever. Until we meet again, Lada.”
- Her reaction: a subtle smile, slightly misty eyes, a shift in posture that signals renewed strength.
- The camera lingers on her thoughtful expression, then pulls back slowly as discussion resumes around her.

## Intended Emotion
This scene anchors the emotional continuity of the series—showing how personal impact and geopolitical relevance intertwine. It offers a gentle release after the intensity of the keynote, reinforcing that behind strategy and theory, human connection endures.
