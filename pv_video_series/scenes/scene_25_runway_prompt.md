# Scene 25 – Runway Prompt

**Title:** Anonymous Tip  
**Scene Number:** 25  
**Setting:** London Metropolitan Police Call Center, Night  
**Style:** Moody, restrained, tense procedural

## Prompt for AI Video Generator:

Create a tense and minimalist short scene set inside a late-night London Metropolitan Police call center. A lone operator sits at a terminal amid low lighting, illuminated only by her monitor and soft desk light. The atmosphere is quiet, procedural.

The operator calmly answers an incoming call:  
“London Police, non-emergency inquiries. Is there anything that you’d like to report?”

A voice — anonymous, male, and composed — responds flatly over the phone:  
“Martin Thornick had coffee this morning at Starbucks with documentary producer, Jack Keller.”

The operator reacts with subtle surprise, posture stiffening. She asks,  
“Who is speaking?... Hello, who is speaking?”  
There is no answer — the line clicks dead.

Hold the shot on the operator’s slightly widened eyes and her screen. The moment lingers, letting tension mount. Foreshadow the sense that something bigger is unfolding in the background — unseen actors are moving.

## Visual Style:

- Low-key lighting, quiet audio design
- Sparse visuals, emphasizing emptiness and silence in the call center
- Use of silence and background hum to heighten suspense
- Subtle camera movement or rack focus to indicate unease

## Emotional Register:

- Quiet tension
- Controlled professionalism, disrupted by an unexpected turn
- The unease of a system encountering a signal from the shadows
