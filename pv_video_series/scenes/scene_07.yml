  Florentine, en route to a conference in Nice, is unexpectedly diverted from the airport by a chauffeur to a luxurious hotel in Cap-Ferrat. There, she meets Victor Morozov, who reveals his ulterior motives under the guise of support for her AI research. Tension builds as Florentine resists his manipulations. Just when it escalates, Lada intervenes and helps Florentine escape by foot along the coastal Chemin des Douaniers. They reach safety via a friend’s car and return to Nice, where they bond over lunch and prepare for the conference.
