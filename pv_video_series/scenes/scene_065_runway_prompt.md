RUNWAY PROMPT — Scene 065: Post-Presentation Reactions

Title: Post-Presentation Reactions
Location: Conference Hall A, Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Berlin
Time of Day: Mid-morning

Characters in Scene:
	•	Florentine Fischer (just finished her keynote)
	•	Liesel Porsch (watching GenAI summary feeds)
	•	Lukas Schmidt (preparing to present next)
	•	Julia Vogel (observing political dynamics)
	•	Henrik Bauer (security/intelligence liaison)
	•	Government advisors and ministry staff (audience)
	•	GenAI interface (non-human system)

Visual Style:
	•	Wide-angle shot from the back of the hall capturing the moment applause begins.
	•	Slow push-in on Florentine stepping down from the stage.
	•	Medium close-ups of officials exchanging glances and taking notes.
	•	Insert shot of Liesel’s tablet with the real-time GenAI summary: keyword clusters (“Feasibility,” “Cross-Ministerial Flow,” “Ethical Overlap,” “Implementation Timeline”).
	•	Intimate two-shot of Florentine and Liesel sharing a quiet, satisfied glance.
	•	Reaction shot of Julia, composed but scanning the room like a strategist.
	•	Henrik nods once, noting faces and nonverbal cues.
	•	Lukas adjusting his jacket, shifting forward in his seat, preparing to stand.

Dialogue Cues (minimal):
	•	Liesel (whispering, showing tablet): “Top three concerns. Just came in.”
	•	Florentine (smiles): “As expected.”
	•	Julia (murmuring to herself): “They’re not rejecting it. That’s good.”
	•	Henrik (to himself): “Now we watch.”

Mood Keywords:
Tension turned inward, strategic calm, decision time approaches, quietly electric.

Audio Elements:
	•	Fading applause
	•	Quiet hum of GenAI terminals
	•	Whispered conversations
	•	Chair shifting, tablet taps
	•	Lukas’s breath as he prepares to speak

Music Direction:
	•	Subtle orchestral layer (strings + ambient tones) beneath GenAI audio cues.
	•	Music gently recedes as Lukas rises to take the floor.

Prompt Notes for Runway:
The tone is not celebratory—it’s weighted and reflective. Focus on the silent power of high-level decision-making just after a compelling proposal. Think bridge between persuasion and action. Subtext matters more than action here. Use light and angles to convey tension giving way to traction.
