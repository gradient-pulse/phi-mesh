**Runway Prompt – Scene 13: Post-Lecture Conversations**

**Title**: Scene 13 – Aftermath of the Lecture

**Characters**:
- Professor Florentine Fischer
- Lada Morozov
- International delegates (background characters)

**Location**: Lobby and garden terrace of the Hôtel West End, Nice

**Time**: Early afternoon, shortly after Florentine's keynote lecture

**Visual Style**:
Elegant hotel setting with warm Mediterranean light. Florentine is slightly flushed from the intensity of her lecture and social attention. The atmosphere should feel cosmopolitan yet personal, with soft clinks of coffee cups and murmured conversations in the background.

**Scene Description**:
After finishing her keynote, Florentine exits the conference room and walks into the lobby where delegates are mingling. Several approach her with congratulations, questions, and speaking invitations. She remains composed, thoughtful, yet clearly stimulated by the attention and feedback.

Lada approaches from a side corridor and gently interrupts a conversation to speak with Florentine in private. They move to the garden terrace.

Lada thanks Florentine for the lecture, expressing how deeply the idea of "question-driven AGI" resonated with her. She confides that her generation is looking for new anchors of meaning and believes that Florentine’s view of AI might offer one.

Florentine listens, intrigued and slightly emotional. She asks Lada about her background and plans. They discuss the moral tensions between their worlds—the academic and the oligarchic—and how each seeks control over uncertain futures.

The scene ends with the two women quietly observing the sea. A breeze lifts Lada's hair. The unspoken connection between them—across generations, cultures, and ideologies—becomes momentarily clear.

**Narrative Purpose**:
To reflect the personal impact of Florentine’s ideas, establish a bond between her and Lada, and show that change begins in subtle acts of shared understanding.

**Technical Notes**:
- Background characters should reflect an international mix: South American, European, African, Southeast Asian.
- Soft piano or ambient strings might underscore the terrace dialogue if audio is added.
- Avoid overemphasis. Let silence and body language carry meaning.

**Closing Shot**:
A medium-wide shot from behind the women, overlooking the sea. The waves suggest continuity, memory, and drift.
