Runway Prompt for Scene 37 — The Journalist’s Prep

Scene Title: The Journalist’s Prep
Style Reference: Light drama with slight romantic undercurrent — think The Newsroom meets Before Sunrise

⸻

Visual Style & Tone
	•	Set in a modern London newsroom—glass partitions, glowing monitors, muted buzz of activity.
	•	Ollie Blackwood is the center of attention: rugged, slightly out of place in a digital newsroom, wearing a blazer over a black T-shirt.
	•	Light, naturalistic lighting with a slight warm filter to humanize the tension.

⸻

Scene Breakdown
	1.	Interior – British Herald Office – Late Morning
	•	Ollie walks through the newsroom, greeted casually by a colleague.
	•	Camera follows behind, framing Ollie in shallow focus as background blurs — conveys his inward focus.
	•	Quick cut: Ollie enters the restroom, checks hair, adjusts his collar, and gives himself a pep talk in the mirror (voiceless, just expression and body language).
	2.	Transition to Exterior – British Herald Building
	•	Ollie exits, steps into the sunlight, squints upward, then walks briskly down the street.
	•	Passes a coffee cart, declines a free sample, looks at his phone again.
	•	Camera lingers for a few seconds on his face — mix of excitement and tension.

⸻

Sound Design & Music
	•	Ambient sounds: newsroom chatter, restroom fan, faint traffic.
	•	Add a light piano-driven cue with a rising tone of anticipation.
	•	End the scene with soft street ambience and the music fading as Ollie rounds a corner.

⸻

Emotional Focus
	•	Show Ollie’s vulnerability and excitement. This is more than just a professional interview.
	•	The audience should sense that something deeper is awakening in him.
