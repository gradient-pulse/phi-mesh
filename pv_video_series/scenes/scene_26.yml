description: |
  Florentine returns from Nice to a gloomy London morning, facing an unannounced visit from Liesel Porsch, who relays a threatening message she received on Florentine’s behalf. As Florentine follows up with Dr. Maximilian Weber from the German delegation, she is offered both reassurance and a cryptic invitation to a secretive project. Meanwhile, Weber coordinates with his Berlin-based team, confirming that Florentine is onboard while responding to the security threat and preparing for high-level AI-policy integration. Back in London, Florentine debriefs Geoffrey Hargreaves and reassures Liesel—who ends the day warmly received by Florentine’s family. Liesel later receives a surprising call from journalist Ollie Blackwood.
