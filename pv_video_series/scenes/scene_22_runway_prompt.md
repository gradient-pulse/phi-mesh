## Runway Prompt for Scene 22: Anonymous Tip

### Core Prompt:
Generate a cinematic scene set in the London Metropolitan Police non-emergency call center at night. The camera focuses on a single police operator who answers a routine call. An anonymous, filtered voice delivers a chilling and concise tip: “Martin Thornick had coffee this morning at Starbucks with documentary producer, Jack Keller.” Before the operator can reply, the line disconnects. The operator, now alert, logs the call into the system. The scene ends on a close-up of the computer screen displaying Keller’s name.

### Visual Details:
- Dimly lit, cool-toned open office space with rows of empty call stations
- Operator is wearing a headset, illuminated mostly by their screen
- Caller’s voice is distorted, anonymized
- Operator’s face transitions from disinterest to focused concern
- The call log entry becomes a visual anchor for tension

### Camera Instructions:
- Begin with a wide shot of the quiet call center
- Medium shot of the operator picking up the call
- Tight close-up on screen and face during the call
- End with a slow zoom on the call log: "Jack Keller"

### Sound and Tone:
- Low ambient hum of electronics and distant chatter
- Sudden clarity when the anonymous voice speaks
- A subtle musical cue after the line drops — foreboding but restrained

### Intended Effect:
Create a brief but suspenseful scene that hints at the beginning of a covert investigation or political setup. This marks a pivot point in the series — a signal that the circle around Keller and Florentine is tightening.
