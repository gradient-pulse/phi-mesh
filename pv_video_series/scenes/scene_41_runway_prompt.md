# Scene 41 – Runway Prompt

## Title:
Encounter at the Print Room Café

## Visual Style Prompt:
A soft golden-hour scene transitions into warm interior lighting. The exterior of Taviton Street shows Florentine exiting a classic academic building to meet Lada Morozov, who waits casually but alertly. As they greet each other with polite warmth, the camera follows them walking through the campus grounds of University College London—light dappling through trees, students and staff in the background. They enter the Print Room Café, a quiet, warmly lit space filled with wooden furniture, books, and the quiet hum of conversation.

Close-ups capture their facial expressions—cordial but probing. The café provides a contrast: cozy and intimate, yet the dialogue hints at deeper geopolitical undertones.

## Characters:
- **Florentine Fischer**: composed, intellectually agile, wary but courteous
- **Lada Morozov**: observant, charismatic, poised, with a hint of strategic intent

## Setting:
- Exterior: Taviton Street, UCL (early evening, golden light)
- Interior: Print Room Café (warm, modern-academic ambiance, low ambient chatter)

## Key Actions:
- Florentine exits building, sees Lada, greets her
- They walk across campus, chatting lightly
- They enter the café, order drinks, and settle at a corner table
- Emotional undercurrents and body language suggest deeper implications

## Dialogue Fragments (voiceover or lipsynced):
- "Great to see you again, Florentine."
- "Same here, Lada."
- "Let’s grab something at the Print Room Café, just around the corner."

## Mood:
- Friendly on the surface, but layered with strategic tension
- A scene where personal trust and political uncertainty quietly intersect

## Camera Notes:
- Tracking shots of their walk through campus
- Interior wide shots followed by close-ups
- Emphasis on facial microexpressions and natural hand gestures

## Music Direction:
Start with warm string melodies, adding light ambient piano as they enter the café. A subtle undercurrent of tension in the score as the scene progresses—something left unsaid.
