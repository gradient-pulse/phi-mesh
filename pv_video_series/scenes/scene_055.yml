camera_notes: >
  Begin with wide shot of the brasserie interior, then shift to an intimate dinner-table dialogue style. Use medium shots with shallow depth of field to isolate expressions. Incorporate reaction shots for Julia, Lukas, and especially Bauer.

music_cue: >
  Sparse piano or low strings—sophisticated but not sentimental. Let silence do much of the work, with audio dips during key realizations or foreshadowing remarks.
