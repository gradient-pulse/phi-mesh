## Runway Prompt — Scene 20: Berlin Response

**Scene Title:** Berlin Response  
**Setting:** Editorial office of The British Herald, London — late afternoon  
**Characters:**  
- Liesel Porsch (sharp German journalist, multilingual, pragmatic)  
- Arthur (editorial colleague)  
- Unnamed German caller (voice only)

**Prompt for Runway:**  
Generate a short cinematic sequence (10–20 seconds) set inside a calm but focused newsroom environment. Use muted natural lighting, with background ambient office noise (keyboards, low chatter, distant ringing). 

- Begin with a wide shot of the editorial office at dusk.
- Cut to Arthur standing by his desk, calling across: “Liesel, Arthur here. I've got Germany on the line… Can you take it, please?”
- Pan to Liesel at her workstation, turning slowly toward the camera.  
- Close-up of her face, neutral yet alert.  
- She answers the phone with quiet authority: “Liesel Porsch, Guten Tag…”  
- The voice on the other end is inaudible, but Liesel’s shifting posture and nodding indicate something serious.
- The camera lingers a beat on her expression as soft dramatic music fades in.

**Visual Mood Board Hints:**  
- Think European journalism: subtle tension, muted colors, utilitarian desks, cluttered notes.
- Daylight giving way to lamplight: a symbolic transition.
- Cinematography: handheld or steady glide-cam for realism.
