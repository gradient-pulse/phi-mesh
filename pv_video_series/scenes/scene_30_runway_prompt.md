## Scene 30 — Runway Prompt

**Project Title:** Palpable Voice — Cinematic Series  
**Episode:** Chapter 6 – Non-Disclosure  
**Scene:** 30  
**Title:** The NDA and the Chancellor’s Shadow

### Visual Goal
Present the formal signing of the Non-Disclosure Agreement as both a symbolic and practical rite of passage. The atmosphere should feel like a crossing of thresholds — from academic independence to state-aligned power.

### Visual Style Guide
- **Architecture & Light:** Stark, German modernism. Austerely lit corridors. Reflections from brushed steel, glass, and matte walls.
- **Color Palette:** Muted blues and greys, with a faint golden glow from interior light sources to suggest weight and secrecy.
- **Cinematography:**
  - Low-angle shot of the Ministry building.
  - Tracking shot as Florentine and Liesel are led through the corridor.
  - Over-the-shoulder shot of Dr. Weber placing the NDA folder on the table.
  - Close-up of Florentine’s eyes as she signs — unwavering.
  - Liesel hesitates — insert shot of her hand fidgeting before she picks up the pen.

### Emotional Focus
- **Florentine:** Steadfast, aware she’s crossing a line that will mark her legacy.
- **Liesel:** More anxious but committed to follow Florentine, with glimmers of inner strength forming.
- **Weber:** Smooth, assertive, yet keeps glancing at the empty chair meant for the Chancellor — a visual device to suggest unseen authority.

### Audio
- **Soundscape:** Faint echo of distant heels on tile. Soft hum of ventilation.
- **Dialogue:** Muted; keep it minimal. The weight is in silence and gesture.
- **Music Cue:** Low cello motif becomes a piano ripple when the pen scratches the signature — signifying the irreversible moment.

### Scene Purpose
Seal the pact. This is where the academic world begins serving the state, mediated by AI and sealed in bureaucracy. It makes Florentine’s mission real. And risky.
