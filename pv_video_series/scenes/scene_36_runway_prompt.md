scene_style: Cinematic, introspective, natural lighting

prompt for Runway or other AI video generator:
Generate a tranquil, introspective walking sequence set in Russell Square Gardens, London, during a partly cloudy late morning. The central figure is Florentine Fischer (mid-50s, thoughtful, poised), dressed in a dark overcoat, walking slowly along the garden path. She is alone and deep in thought.

The park is lush with spring greenery, dappled sunlight through trees, soft shadows. Show subtle details: Florentine passing a fountain, children playing in the distance, joggers, elderly people on benches. The camera should linger behind her and occasionally shift to frontal or side profiles to capture her contemplative expression. Her inner monologue reflects on the tension between data privacy and AI-enhanced governance—capture this tone visually, even if no voiceover is included.

Eventually, the mood lifts slightly—Florentine slows, takes in her surroundings with a small breath or faint smile. She exits the park, turns a corner toward a small Italian restaurant (Zizzi). As she walks away, the camera rises slightly, showing the skyline with historic buildings.

style references:
	•	Her (2013) for color grading and emotional tone
	•	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for pacing and introspective framing
	•	Soft, steady cam or slow dolly movement

music direction (optional):
Low ambient piano with soft string swells—reflecting internal processing, not sadness

notes:
Do not include dialog. Rely entirely on body language, pacing, and setting to convey her inner ethical and philosophical conflict. Avoid dramatization—this scene should feel grounded, real, and meditative.
