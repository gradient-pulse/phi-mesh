  Lukas steps up with measured confidence, transitioning from the societal model to its technical backbone.
  He begins with a striking quote about AI’s global momentum, citing recent calls for multi-trillion dollar investments.
  A rotating 3D infrastructure model appears behind him—data hubs, energy plants, secure comms nodes.
  He maps out the modular layers of Germany’s national AI-infrastructure blueprint, explaining how it can integrate existing assets, meet strategic autonomy goals, and scale with minimal bureaucratic friction.
  He paces his speech calmly, referencing Florentine’s earlier themes to show alignment.
  Florentine and Liesel exchange glances as GenAI highlights overlap with the unity–disunity framework.
  Julia Vogel nods silently—this is the piece she needed to make the operational case stick.
