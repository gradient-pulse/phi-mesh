Runway Prompt for Scene 056: “Morning of the Mission”

Visual Style:
Naturalistic lighting with a dignified, cinematic tone. Use soft morning sunlight filtering through sheer curtains. Subtle camera movement to create a calm but anticipatory rhythm. Prioritize close-up details of preparation—hands zipping a bag, eyes checking notes, steam rising from a teacup.

Setting:
Interior – Hotel Adlon Kempinski suite, Berlin. Elegant, quiet, well-appointed. Light tones in the decor, contemporary but respectful of the building’s history. Establish a warm, neutral color palette (beige, cream, muted blue) to convey mental clarity and focus.

Characters:
	•	Florentine Fischer – poised, focused, her academic calm in balance with the historical weight of her role.
	•	Liesel Porsch – alert, energized, balancing professional precision with youthfully expressed excitement.
	•	Karl (referenced only) – through a note under the door, his presence is felt but not shown.

Actions to Render:
	•	Florentine adjusting her blazer in the mirror, pausing in reflection.
	•	Liesel scanning a digital tablet with GenAI summaries, fingers scrolling.
	•	Subtle exchange of glances or words between them conveying mutual trust and quiet resolve.
	•	Cut to a hotel corridor as they exit, light casting long shadows.
	•	Final shot: sleek government car waiting outside, black against the soft morning light.

Mood & Atmosphere:
Quiet determination. Dignity. A subdued but unmistakable sense of stepping into history. Emphasize the stillness before motion, thought before speech.

Optional VFX / Animation Notes:
	•	Time overlay: “Wednesday – 08:10 AM, Hotel Adlon Kempinski”
	•	Ambient city noise as subtle background (birds, distant traffic, rustling trees)
	•	Fade into next scene with engine start and city street in motion.
