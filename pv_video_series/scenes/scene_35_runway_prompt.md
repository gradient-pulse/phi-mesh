Title: The Codename Trap

Florentine sits in her UCL office, mid-morning light filtering through the blinds. She’s on a call with Dr. Weber (voice only), the tone serious yet composed. As they speak, she proposes a classic counter-intelligence tactic: using unique project codenames when speaking to different contacts.

Visual Instructions:
	•	Start with a wide shot of Florentine in her office, then cut to medium close-ups during the call.
	•	Show over-the-shoulder view as she opens her laptop and interacts with GenAI—typing: “I need four distinct, historically significant German names suitable for a project codename.”
	•	Show screen as names populate: “Leibnitz,” “Bismarck,” “Gutenberg,” “Humboldt.”
	•	As she discusses assigning these to different contacts (Lada, family, Arthur, Liesel), intercut GenAI responses with reaction shots.
	•	Subtle emphasis on her control, composure, and ethical awareness.

Moodboard & Aesthetic:
	•	Palette: steel blue, dusty beige, soft daylight
	•	Textures: clean paper, brushed aluminum laptop, soft interior lighting
	•	Emotions: alertness, strategic calculation, inner steadiness

Transition to Exterior:
	•	She ends the call, shuts her laptop, tears out a page from her notebook, scribbles “Gutenberg project” across it, and leaves it casually on the desk.
	•	Wide shot as she exits the building.
	•	Tracking camera follows her into Russell Square Gardens. The green, the soft breeze, her walking alone—these contrast with the cerebral tension of the prior scene.

Voiceover Option (Florentine, internal):

“Balance without imbalance is meaningless… just like trust without risk.”

End scene as she finds a bench, quietly observing the city around her, notebook page lingering in memory.
