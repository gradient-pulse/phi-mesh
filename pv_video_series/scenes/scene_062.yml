description: >
  Immediately following the Chancellor’s private briefing, a smaller group reconvenes in a secondary room to digest what was said and plan actionable next steps. The tone is less formal, more fluid—intellectually charged. Some are energized, others cautious. 

  Lukas pulls up infrastructure readiness maps. Julia pushes hiring timelines forward. Clara insists on layering in public communication milestones. Rudolf raises ethical-legal speed bumps. Henrik calmly states early signs of alignment resistance. Meanwhile, Florentine and Liesel field questions but also listen carefully, mapping social dynamics. Tensions are productive.

  The frozen murmuration on-screen becomes a touchstone: each dot a node, each line a possibility.

  Begin with mid-shot of doors closing behind them. Switch to over-the-shoulder shots as participants take seats or stand in animated stances. Use occasional wide-angle to show entire flow-space of the room—movement matters here.

  Close-ups on reactions to each idea. Subtle rack-focus shifts between foreground disagreement and background contemplation.

sound_design: >
  Tapping of stylus on screen. Murmured interjections. One outburst from Rudolf. The soft buzz of screen electronics. Faint background traffic outside the building—Berlin is alive beyond these walls.

music_cue: >
  Low string ostinato builds during Lukas' infrastructure talk. A brief dissonance when Rudolf challenges. Return to clarity when Liesel reframes the murmuration metaphor.

mood: >
  Electric tension. Minds colliding. Urgency without panic. The room feels like a nerve center—this is where vision sharpens into directive.
