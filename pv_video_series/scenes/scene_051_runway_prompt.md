# Scene 051 – Sparks and Signals

## Visual Prompt for Runway / Veo / AI Video Model

**Setting:**  
Evening outside a London tube station, then inside the warmly lit living room of the Keller residence.

**Characters on screen:**  
- Candace (mid-20s, composed, modern style, emotionally intelligent)  
- Lada (early 20s, expressive, intellectual aura, slightly impulsive)  
- Jack and Florentine (late 50s–60s, warm couple, relaxed at home)

**Visual Flow:**  
- Start with Candace and Lada walking side-by-side, gentle dusk light on their faces, soft street sounds in the background.  
- Lada turns to Candace, visibly nervous, and says, “Candace, I might feel more than just liking you…”  
- Candace halts slightly, a subtle flicker of emotion crosses her face. She replies calmly, “I can be your friend, Lada, but I can never be your lover.”  
- Lada nods with a bittersweet smile, steps down into the tube entrance, and disappears into the arriving train.  
- Transition to the Keller living room. Jack is pacing slowly, inspired.  
- Florentine joins him. He shares his enthusiasm for the documentary.  
- Close-up as Florentine says, “Why don’t you ask Ollie Blackwood?”  
- Jack pauses, then lights up: “Bingo.”

**Emotional Tone:**  
- Tender but grounded. A delicate rejection handled with care.  
- Followed by a contemplative shift—a mature couple planting narrative seeds for what’s to come.

**Suggested Style:**  
- Cinematic realism, muted London palette outdoors; warm amber tones indoors.  
- Subtle facial expressions and micro-reactions are key.

**Music Direction:**  
- Solo violin with ambient piano, rising slightly during Lada’s confession and softening again when she departs.

**Scene Purpose:**  
- Establish emotional complexity between Lada and Candace.  
- Set up a documentary subplot led by Jack.  
- Reintroduce Ollie Blackwood as a key thread.
