Title: The Origin of the Threat
Scene Number: 31
Setting:
Interior – Berlin – Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy – Early morning.
Sparse light enters a sleek, modern office. The city skyline glows dimly behind vertical blinds.

Visual Style:
Cinematic realism. Cool-toned palette. Shadow and light interplay across a quiet workspace.
Focus on stillness and composed gestures. Draw inspiration from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy in mood.

Key Characters:
	•	Dr. Weber: Late 50s, calm, meticulous. Wears a tailored dark suit, seated at a large desk.
	•	Henrik Bauer (voice only): German intelligence liaison, clipped tone, steady.

Prompt Description for Runway:
A government office in Berlin before dawn. Inside, one light is on. Dr. Weber answers a ringing phone and listens intently. The conversation (heard in voiceover) reveals a threat tied to an external actor—specifically, a phone call from the UK. As the news sinks in, Weber slowly stands, walks to the large window, and contemplates the unfolding international implications. His face shows resolve more than concern. The scene ends with a long pause, city noise low in the background.

Dialogue Snippet (voiceover-style):
Henrik Bauer (VO): “We traced the origin… It came from the UK.”
Weber (VO): “That complicates matters. Inside borders is one thing… beyond them, quite another.”

Shot Suggestions:
	•	Wide establishing shot: Early dawn city, ministry building with one window lit.
	•	Interior: Medium shot of Weber answering the phone, slightly backlit.
	•	Cut-in: Weber’s hand tightening on the pen.
	•	Close-up: His composed but alert face during the call.
	•	Final shot: Weber staring out the window, framed by soft dawn light.

Mood & Music:
Sparse ambient tones. No score until the UK revelation. Then, a low cello note underscores the shift. Clock ticks in background, almost inaudible until the final moment.
