summary: >
  Oliver Blackwood meets with Geoffrey Hargreaves at University College London to
  atone for the damage done by his misleading article on Florentine. He proposes
  transforming the retracted piece into the opening of a redemptive series on AI,
  fake news, and Professor Fischer’s research. Hargreaves listens coldly, then
  surprisingly produces a ready-to-sign agreement—crafted, it seems, by AI.

  Natural daylight from a high window. Static framing, almost documentary-style.
  Emphasize the subtle unease and emotional shift in Ollie’s expression. Cutaways
  to the AI-signed document scrolling through on a nearby printer or screen, eerie
  in its precision.
