A refined international conference reception at Hôtel West End, Nice. The setting is a softly lit ballroom with chandeliers and round tables, elegantly decorated. Diverse delegates from around the world sit dressed in formal attire, some engaged in quiet conversations, others focused on a woman at the podium.

Professor Florentine Fischer stands in formal evening wear, delivering a keynote speech. She is poised and articulate, projecting confidence. Her words are calm but profound.

The camera slowly pans across the audience, capturing subtle reactions: intrigued glances, thoughtful nods, subtle smiles. Behind her, a large screen shows minimal graphics—only the title of her talk.

Focus on Florentine saying:
“Our task is not just to provide answers to our world, but especially also questions.
We’ll recognize AGI not by the answers that it provides but by its questions. These reveal its self-awareness, as they reveal ours.”

Emphasize elegance, ambiance, and gravity of the moment. Light reflections, subtle musical underscore, and soft background chatter after she finishes speaking.
