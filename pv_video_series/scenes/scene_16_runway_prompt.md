- **Oliver Blackwood**: Late 20s, thoughtful but anxious. Dressed in business-casual (dark sweater, no tie). Light stubble. He holds a notepad and glances nervously around.
- **Geoffrey Hargreaves**: Early 60s, formal, composed. Wears a gray suit and thin-rimmed glasses. Speaks slowly and methodically. Wields subtle authority.

### Key Actions to Depict

1. **Ollie enters the administrative building** – slight pause at reception; signs in.
2. **Seated alone in small, minimalist conference room** – subdued lighting; overhead screen off.
3. **Hargreaves enters and listens quietly** – no interruption, cold expression.
4. **Ollie speaks earnestly** – makes his proposal to transform his past error into a redemptive series.
5. **Hargreaves departs and returns with printed agreement** – emphasis on printer sound, swift signature motion.
6. **Ollie signs** – facial expression softens; close-up of signature and legal text.
7. **Closing shot** – Ollie leaves holding signed paper; shot lingers on his face: relief, reflection, redemption.

### Emotional & Cinematic Cues

- Use sound design: muffled hallway noises, ticking clock, printer sounds.
- Highlight institutional stillness contrasted with Ollie’s anxiety.
- Music: minimal ambient tones, subtle chord shifts when the AI-generated contract appears.
