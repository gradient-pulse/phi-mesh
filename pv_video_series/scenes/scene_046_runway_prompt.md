# Scene 046 – Runway Prompt

## Visual Goal
Create an intimate yet strategically charged bedroom scene set on a serene Saturday morning. The setting should convey warmth, mutual respect, and inspiration as Jack proposes a documentary about Florentine’s work. The scene should visually transition from affection to reflection, culminating in Florentine’s redirection toward a documentary on fake news.

## Setting
- Interior: Keller bedroom, morning light filtering through large curtained windows.
- Florentine and Jack are sitting up in bed, cozy and comfortable, drinking tea.
- A single flower in a glass on the nightstand adds a subtle, symbolic touch.

## Characters
- **Florentine Fischer**: Composed, thoughtful, protective of her larger mission. Wearing a silk robe, she shifts from affection to strategic deflection.
- **Jack Keller**: Documentary producer, relaxed yet driven by creative inspiration. He floats the idea of making Florentine the subject of his next film.

## Key Visual Beats
1. Jack enters with tea and flower – soft morning light frames the moment.
2. Florentine receives it with a smile – camera captures their quiet affection.
3. As they sip tea, Jack pitches the documentary – slight shift in tone.
4. Florentine deflects gently, offering the fake news angle instead.
5. Jack responds with curiosity and enthusiasm – playful, enlightened.
6. He jumps out of bed to make breakfast – cut with humor and warmth.

## Camera Suggestions
- Medium close-up of hands exchanging tea and flower.
- Wide shot of both in bed with overhead soft lighting.
- Reaction shots as the conversation deepens.
- Camera lingers on Florentine’s expression as she redirects the conversation.

## Mood & Music
- Early morning tranquility, underscored by light instrumental (piano or acoustic guitar).
- As topic shifts to fake news, underscore with a curious, thought-provoking tone.

## Notes
This is the beginning of a subplot: the birth of the fake news documentary thread. Convey the layered intimacy and visionary undertone of this exchange. Keep the pace slow and human, with soft transitions between personal affection and societal intent.
