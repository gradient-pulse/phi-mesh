```yaml
scene_number: 15
title: Restless Night, Ruthless Links
chapter: 5
location: Victor Morozov's bedroom, pre-dawn
characters:
  - Victor Morozov
  - Martin Thornick (dream sequence)
time: 4:00 AM
visual_style: Dimly lit room, warm shadows, sweat-drenched bedsheets, flickering light from phone screen
emotional_tone: Anxiety, guilt, paranoia
summary: |
  Victor Morozov wakes up from a disturbing dream drenched in sweat. In the dream, political consultant Martin Thornick appears as a linking threat between Victor, Florentine, and Jack Keller. Fearing exposure, Victor grabs his phone and contacts Thornick via Telegram's Secret Chat. The audience sees only the first name typed, but the subtext is clear: clean-up has begun.

camera_directions:
  - Close-up on Victor’s eyes snapping open
  - Tilt down to reveal his soaked shirt and trembling hand
  - Insert shot: Telegram app interface, fingers typing "Thornick"
  - Cut to black before message sends
notes:
  - Sound design should include rapid breathing, distant city noise, and a subtle phone buzz
  - Lighting should reflect mental claustrophobia; warm but oppressive
```
