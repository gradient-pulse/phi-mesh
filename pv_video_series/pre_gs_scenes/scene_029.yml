  Begin with a long shot of the jet taxiing and slowing to a halt. Use tight shots on the faces of Florentine and Liesel as they disembark—minimal dialogue, emphasis on eyes and posture. Medium tracking shot as they walk toward the waiting officers. Conclude with a slow-moving interior car shot, the skyline reflected in the car’s window glass.

music_cue: Ambient orchestral strings building tension, with subtle industrial undertones—conveying the seriousness of state power.
