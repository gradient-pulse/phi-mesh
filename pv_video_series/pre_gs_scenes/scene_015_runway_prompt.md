# Runway Prompt: Scene 015 — The Golden Rule

> ⚠️ *Note: This scene was created prior to strict Gradient Syntax mapping and may include inferred transitions or psychological cues. It is preserved here for archival and contrast purposes.*

**Scene Context:**  
This is a multilayered speech-and-dialogue scene featuring Professor Florentine Fischer as the keynote speaker at an international peace conference. She introduces her "Unity-Disunity" (UD) societal model—a foundational AI ethics and strategy framework. Her delivery is calm, rational, and quietly forceful. The audience contains delegates, scholars, and political observers.

**Setting:**  
- Ornate conference hall of Hôtel West End in Nice, France  
- Scene alternates between podium closeups, audience reactions, and intercuts of illustrative footage (e.g., starlings, pin factory, Rome skyline)  
- Lighting is warm but sober; atmosphere intellectual, alert, and slightly tense.

**Visual Cues & Inserts:**  
- Cutaway inserts of starling murmuration, pin factory processes, AI data streams  
- On-screen overlays of key quotes: “Unity is entanglement. Disunity is division of labor.”  
- Include real-time audience reactions: nods, confusion, interest, concern  
- Emphasize Florentine’s visual poise and confident cadence

**Narrative Arc:**  
Florentine builds her case progressively, from the Golden Rule to historical cycles to the UD Paradox. Her goal is not persuasion but provocation—she wants her audience, human and AI alike, to begin *asking the right questions*.

**Instructions for Runway Gen-2 or equivalent:**  
- Use stable camera with intelligent motion (e.g., slow dolly in during key moments)  
- Match cuts between her speech and symbolic visuals (birds, factories, war maps, etc.)  
- Keep tone elegant, not bombastic  
- Runtime: ~2.5 minutes

**Character Reference:**  
Florentine Fischer — mid-50s, intelligent, poised, American-European blend; speaks with calm clarity.

**Voice/Style Cues:**  
- Think early TED Talk meets UN Assembly  
- Use clear English; slight European accent acceptable  
- Background noise minimal, respectful murmurs okay
