description: |
  Florentine, feeling a growing unease, is introduced to Victor Morozov — the man responsible for redirecting her car from the airport. Their conversation is cordial but fraught, revealing his interest in her research for questionable motives. The tension spikes when Morozov’s daughter, Lada, appears unexpectedly. The atmosphere shifts from threat to ambiguity.

  The elegant hotel lobby becomes a space of performative civility and veiled intentions. Florentine maintains her composure, suspicious yet careful. Lada’s entrance feels like a lifeline but comes with her own family entanglements. Florentine begins to understand how deep and strange her work's implications reach.
