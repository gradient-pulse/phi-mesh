> ⚠️ *Note: This scene was created prior to strict Gradient Syntax mapping and may include inferred transitions or psychological cues. It is preserved here for archival and contrast purposes.*

**Visual Style**:  
Elegant and cerebral. Think Wes Anderson lighting meets BBC political drama. Golden-hour tones with deep focus on facial expressions and gestures during the reception. Linger on intellectual tension and earned poise.

**Characters & Direction**:  
- **Florentine**: In her formal dress, commanding yet thoughtful. Show her prepping the speech with Asimov’s book beside her — a silent co-thinker.  
- **Lada**: Present but subtly defiant. She plays a background protector role, now civilian, no longer rescuing — but bearing witness.  
- **Delegates**: Polite, curious, diplomatic. Include multiple nationalities, different reactions to her ideas.  
- **Reception Staff**: Efficient, reverent, almost ceremonial.

**Key Shots**:  
- Close-up: Florentine flipping through Asimov, underlined lines about psychohistory.  
- Wide shot: Conference hall preparing. Gentle chatter builds atmosphere.  
- Mid-shot: Florentine walking toward the stage. Backlit — like a spotlight in reverse.  
- Dialogue over ambient: “Our task is not just to provide answers... but questions.”  
- Cut to: Reactions — Argentina’s delegate nods slowly, Indonesia's writes notes.

**Sound Design**:  
- Soft classical string ambient, transitions to piano during the speech.  
- Diegetic sounds: silverware, soft clinking, murmurs in multiple languages.  
- Fade to silence as Florentine delivers her final line.

**Prompt Summary** (for Runway or Veo):  
“Elegant evening conference at a classical hotel in Nice. A composed female professor delivers a thought-provoking speech about AGI and societal change. International delegates listen, visibly intrigued. Her dress, book, and calm posture radiate intellect. Golden-hour light, sophisticated ambiance, modern yet timeless tone.”
