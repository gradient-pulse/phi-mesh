**Visual Style**:  
Florentine’s office is quiet, naturally lit but slightly cool in tone. Focus on her face—alert, calm, precise. Use gentle handheld camera movements to follow her as she walks to the window, pauses, then returns to her desk. The GenAI screen glows with scrolling names. Minimalist, intellectual atmosphere with subtle tension. Background audio: soft ticking clock, the hum of London beyond the window.

**Scene Action**:  
Florentine receives a secured call from Dr. Weber. He informs her the threatening phone call was traced to the UK. She absorbs the information and pivots into action. She proposes assigning a different codename for the project to each contact in her network—a classical counter-intelligence tactic. She opens her laptop and types into GenAI: “Four historically resonant German names for a sensitive AI project.” The screen displays: “Leibnitz. Bismarck. Gutenberg. Humboldt.” She calmly lists these to Weber. He agrees, impressed.

She then raises the issue of her NDA, cautioning against potential breach. She proposes to consult UCL’s legal advisor, Dr. Hargreaves. Weber knows Hargreaves by name, which surprises her. They agree to let Bauer follow up with an addendum. Florentine ends the call, writes “Gutenberg Project” on a piece of paper, and sets it casually on her desk.

**Character Cues**:
- **Florentine**: Collected, intellectually alert, with rising strategic intensity.  
- **Weber** (voice): Neutral German male voice, composed but firm.  

**Key Emotions**:  
Cerebral focus, latent paranoia, understated courage. A shift from reaction to control.

**Closing Shot**:  
Zoom on the sheet of paper with “Gutenberg Project” written in neat script. Fade out.
