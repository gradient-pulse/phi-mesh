summary: |
  Victor Morozov wakes up from a disturbing dream drenched in sweat. In the dream, political consultant Martin Thornick appears as a linking threat between Victor, Florentine, and Jack Keller. Fearing exposure, Victor grabs his phone and contacts Thornick via Telegram's Secret Chat. The audience sees only the first name typed, but the subtext is clear: clean-up has begun.

camera_directions:
  - Close-up on Victor’s eyes snapping open
  - Tilt down to reveal his soaked shirt and trembling hand
  - Insert shot: Telegram app interface, fingers typing "Thornick"
  - Cut to black before message sends
notes:
  - Sound design should include rapid breathing, distant city noise, and a subtle phone buzz
  - Lighting should reflect mental claustrophobia; warm but oppressive
