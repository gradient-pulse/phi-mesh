> ⚠️ *Note: This scene was created prior to strict Gradient Syntax mapping and may include inferred transitions or psychological cues. It is preserved here for archival and contrast purposes.*

**Setting:** Online news service office, late evening  
**Visual Style:** Dimly lit office space, a solitary screen glowing in an otherwise quiet newsroom.  
**Mood:** Tension emerging from calm routine; subtle but impactful.

## Prompt

Generate a cinematic scene where Candace Keller, a young online journalist, is finishing up her shift at a London-based news service. The office is mostly empty, quiet, lit primarily by the glow of computer monitors. She’s scrolling through headlines when her eyes lock on a breaking news bulletin: *“Political Consultant Martin Thornick Found Dead in His Home – Suspected Heart Attack.”*

Make the camera slowly zoom in on her screen to emphasize the name. Then show a close-up of her reaction — focused, but emotionally reserved. She quickly takes a photo of the screen with her phone and sends it via messaging app with the caption: “Isn’t that one of your business relations, dad?”

Include subtle ambient music (low piano notes, soft synth) and a minimalist digital interface aesthetic.

### Scene actions:
- Candace’s finger scrolls.
- Headline appears.
- Reaction shot: pause, blink, slight lean-in.
- Snap of screen photo.
- Message sent.
- Phone screen shows: “Delivered.”
- Fade out on her face, unreadable expression.

This scene should quietly propel narrative tension forward, hinting that threads from Jack Keller’s world are about to unravel in front of his daughter.
