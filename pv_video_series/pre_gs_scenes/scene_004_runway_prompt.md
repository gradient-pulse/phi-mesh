summary: |
Ollie’s speculative article goes live. It frames the train explosion as a potential sign of civil unrest in the UK.
The headline circulates rapidly across social media, catching the attention of insiders and civilians alike.
Meanwhile, Florentine and Liesel, unaware of its release, walk through UCL’s courtyard after their meeting.

A message pops up on Florentine’s phone—Arthur forwarding a news link. Her pace slows.

Liesel reads over her shoulder. Silence. Then: “It’s begun.”
