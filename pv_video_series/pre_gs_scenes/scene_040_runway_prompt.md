Setting: Florentine’s office, early evening. The soft light of sunset filters through the tall windows of University College London. The space is quiet—books, papers, a laptop, and the faint background hum of the city beyond.
Characters:
	•	Florentine Fischer (speaking)
	•	Dr. Hargreaves (voice only, via phone)

Prompt for Runway or equivalent video generator:

Visualize a serene yet weighty moment in Florentine’s office at UCL. She is seated at her desk, reviewing notes, then calmly picks up her phone. Her expression shifts from concern to clarity as she speaks with Dr. Hargreaves about the legal handling of her involvement in the German project.

Begin with a warm, amber-tinged wide shot of her office at dusk, then shift to an over-the-shoulder perspective as she dials and listens. The conversation is grounded, professional, with subtle tension. Use subtitle overlays for clarity if needed.

Dr. Hargreaves’ voice should be calm, seasoned, and protective—projecting institutional authority and trust.

Emphasize the following details:
	•	Florentine gently closing her laptop after the call
	•	Her gaze shifting toward a wall calendar where she’s marked an upcoming trip to Berlin
	•	A moment of stillness as she re-centers herself, then reaches for her notebook

End the scene with a slow fade-out as she opens her GenAI assistant and begins sketching ideas for her upcoming presentation.

Mood & Cinematic Tone:
	•	Quiet authority, strategic pause
	•	Warm lighting, mild shadows suggesting internal reflection
	•	Music: soft ambient or solo piano, fading gently as the screen dims
