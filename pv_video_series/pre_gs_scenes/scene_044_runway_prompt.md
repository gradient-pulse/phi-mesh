Visual Style: Reserved, intellectual, clean light. Interface scenes are subtle, with smooth transitions between human and digital interaction.

Prompt:
Interior, Florentine Fischer’s office at UCL – midday.
Florentine sits in quiet focus at her desk, lit by soft ambient daylight. She opens her laptop and speaks calmly to her GenAI interface. As her voice is heard, visual elements animate: charts, slides, and snippets of code appear and adapt to her words. The interface challenges her politely, offering insights and refinements. The tone is collaborative—Florentine speaks, pauses, listens, responds. Close-ups show her face shift from tension to absorption to slight satisfaction. A pop-up from Henrik Bauer interrupts the flow: she reads it silently, nods, then saves her session. She scribbles “Gutenberg project” on a notepad, tears the page out, and places it on her desk as a symbolic marker. She leaves the room quietly.

Mood & Atmosphere:
Reflective, sharp, ethically tense yet forward-looking. No grand gestures—this is precision cognition in action.

Camera Direction:
Start with an over-the-shoulder view of the GenAI interface evolving. Track Florentine’s eye movements across the screen. Insert subtle on-screen effects to show the GenAI responding in real time. Transition to a static close-up during the NDA message moment, then a slow pull-back as she exits.

Reference Style Cues:
Inspired by subdued scenes in The Imitation Game or AI training montages in Her. Academic but cinematic.
