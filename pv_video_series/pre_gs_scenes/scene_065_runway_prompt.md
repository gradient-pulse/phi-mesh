Title: Post-Presentation Reactions
Location: Chancellor’s Conference Room, Berlin
Time of Day: Mid-morning

Characters in Scene:
	•	Florentine Fischer (just finished her keynote)
	•	Liesel Porsch (watching GenAI summary feeds)
	•	Lukas Schmidt (preparing to present next)
	•	Julia Vogel (observing political dynamics)
	•	Henrik Bauer (security/intelligence liaison)
	•	Senior government advisors (audience)
	•	GenAI interface (non-human system)

Visual Style:
	•	Wide-angle shot from the far side of the Chancellor’s private conference room, showing the ornate yet modern space filled with high-ranking officials seated in semicircular formation.
	•	Slow push-in on Florentine stepping back from the polished wooden podium.
	•	Medium close-ups of ministers and advisors exchanging glances, jotting down notes.
	•	Insert shot of Liesel’s tablet displaying real-time GenAI summary: keyword clusters like “Feasibility,” “Cross-Ministerial Flow,” “Ethical Overlap,” “Implementation Timeline.”
	•	Two-shot of Florentine and Liesel sharing a quiet, grounded look of mutual calibration.
	•	Julia sits poised, absorbing the room’s temperature with seasoned precision.
	•	Henrik quietly observes reactions from a peripheral seat, unreadable.
	•	Lukas subtly shifts forward, adjusting his posture, preparing to enter the flow.

Dialogue Cues (minimal):
	•	Liesel (whispering, showing tablet): “Top three concerns. Just came in.”
	•	Florentine (smiling): “As expected.”
	•	Julia (murmuring to herself): “They’re not rejecting it. That’s good.”
	•	Henrik (low voice): “Now we watch.”

Mood Keywords:
Strategic quiet, institutional momentum, early consensus forming, reflective readiness.

Audio Elements:
	•	Polite, fading applause against soft acoustics of the Chancellor’s high-ceilinged room.
	•	Low GenAI system tones as queries are parsed and categorized.
	•	Subdued whispers, paper shuffles, tablet taps.
	•	Lukas’s steady breath before rising.

Music Direction:
	•	Muted orchestral layer (strings and ambient textures) fades in under the applause.
	•	Music dissolves into near silence as the next segment begins.

Prompt Notes for Runway:
The room feels like a national cockpit—private, pivotal, charged. Subtext is everything: focus on expression, posture, and the flow of unspoken consensus. This is a hinge moment, not a climax. Subtle framing and soft lighting should highlight both hierarchy and the gentle shifting of alignment.
