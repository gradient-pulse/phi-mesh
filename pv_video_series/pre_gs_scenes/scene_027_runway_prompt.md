Prompt:

A quiet, late-night London apartment. Liesel Porsch, Florentine Fischer’s young researcher, enters her modest yet warmly lit flat after an emotionally grounding evening at her mentor’s home. She moves with a subtle tired grace, dropping her bag and gazing out the window at the softly glowing city skyline.

As she prepares for bed, her phone rings. She pauses, curious. The screen shows an unknown number. She answers.

Cut to a phone-only conversation: A warm male voice introduces himself as Oliver Blackwood, a journalist. His tone is unexpectedly respectful. He apologizes for the late call—he just wanted to check if he reached the right person and promises to call again tomorrow.

Liesel responds gently—slightly puzzled but intrigued. After the call ends, she remains still for a moment, the glow of the city brushing her face. She allows herself a faint smile, then turns back into the quiet of her home.

Cinematic Style Cues:
	•	Naturalistic lighting (lamplight and city night tones)
	•	Medium-close shots on Liesel’s expressions
	•	Slight handheld motion to reflect intimacy and realism
	•	Subtle underscore: introspective, hinting at emotional connection
	•	No cutaway to Blackwood—his presence exists only through voice

Voiceover (if needed):
Use authentic-sounding British male voice for Blackwood. Liesel speaks softly, in a neutral European accent. Emphasize the mutual courtesy and budding curiosity.
