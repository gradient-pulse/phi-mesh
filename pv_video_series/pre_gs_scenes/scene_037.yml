note: >
  This scene was created prior to strict Gradient Syntax mapping and may include inferred transitions or psychological cues.

chapter_reference: Chapter 7
location: The British Herald, London
time: Late morning

characters:
	•	Oliver “Ollie” Blackwood – mid-30s, ambitious journalist with a rugged edge
	•	Background colleagues – newsroom staff, indistinct

summary:
Ollie Blackwood prepares for his lunch meeting with Liesel. Though usually confident, today he is slightly nervous and more self-aware than usual. He double-checks his appearance in the bathroom mirror and leaves the British Herald office a bit early to ensure he arrives at the restaurant before Liesel.

camera_notes:
	•	Start with a low-lit office space: early morning newsroom, screens glowing, phones ringing.
	•	Follow Ollie as he walks toward the restroom, adjusting his shirt cuff, checking his phone.
	•	Interior bathroom shot with mirror—he smooths his hair, practices a half-smile, then exhales slowly.
	•	Cut to exterior: Ollie walking purposefully out of the building into sunlight, checking his watch.

tone_mood:
Reflective, slightly humorous, subtly anxious—humanizes Ollie before his meeting.
Music should be light but textured, with undertones of romantic tension.

cut_style:
	•	Smooth cuts, brief montage of his prep sequence
	•	Use ambient sound (office murmur, bathroom tap, street noise) to ground the scene
