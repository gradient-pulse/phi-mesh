> ⚠️ *Note: This scene was created prior to strict Gradient Syntax mapping and may include inferred transitions or psychological cues. It is preserved here for archival and contrast purposes.*

**Visual Style:**  
Naturalistic and cinematic, with early morning golden light filtering through the trees of Hampstead Heath. Cool tones for emotional clarity. Intimate handheld or steadycam for close conversation shots.

**Cinematic Direction:**  
Begin with a wide shot of the empty path in Hampstead Heath. Slowly track Florentine arriving to find Candace already waiting. Follow them from behind as they begin their jog. Intercut wide and medium shots as they speak, with occasional close-ups during emotional beats. Maintain a gentle jogging rhythm throughout, mirroring the emotional steadiness of their bond.

**Dialogue Cues (natural, subtle):**  
- Florentine (noticing): “You’re early today.”
- Candace (muted smile): “Yeah… couldn’t sleep much.”
- [beat as they run]
- Candace (carefully): “Lada said something yesterday… unexpected.”
- [Florentine listens]
- Candace: “She said she might feel more than just liking me.”
- Florentine (quietly, after a pause): “And what did you say?”
- Candace: “That I could be her friend. But never her lover.”
- Florentine (soft, affirming): “You handled it well. These things happen, and you were clear.”

**Emotional Tone:**  
Respectful, tender, slightly melancholic. There is no drama—only the honest, delicate navigation of emotional boundaries. The mother-daughter trust is the anchor.

**Music:**  
Minimal piano score with soft ambient textures; music swells gently during key emotional moments and fades into silence as the scene ends.

**Closing Shot:**  
Aerial shot pulling back as they run farther into the heath, the city slowly emerging in the distance, symbolic of the world waiting beyond their private moment.
