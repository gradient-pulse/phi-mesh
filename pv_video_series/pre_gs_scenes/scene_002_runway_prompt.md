🎥 Visual Description Prompt (Runway)

INT. NEWSROOM – MID-MORNING – THE BRITISH HERALD, LONDON

The camera floats across a packed newsroom, humming with controlled chaos. Dozens of desks form an open grid. Each desk hosts a screen, a messy stack of notes, coffee cups, and the unmistakable pulse of deadline energy. Light from large windows silhouettes the figures.

Cut to:
IAN FLETCHER, late 50s, sharp-featured and thin-lipped, weaves through the maze of desks like a conductor. His reading glasses bounce lightly on a chain around his neck.

He drops a printout on OLLIE BLACKWOOD’s desk.

IAN
(terse, without stopping)
“Castle Cary explosion. Somerset. Yours.”

OLLIE, late 20s, tousled dark hair, alert eyes, scans the printout with interest. He swivels in his chair, starts pacing, scribbles on a notepad.

Cut to:
Quick montage of AI-assisted research:

	•	Ollie typing into an AI journalism dashboard
	•	Rapid on-screen search results
	•	Glimpses of venue names

Ollie dials the Somerset police. Then, The Newt receptionist (AMANDA). We hear her voice over as he listens intently.

Jump cut:
He hangs up, leans back, a glint in his eye.
He types: “Train explosion at Castle Cary Station: A sign of UK’s civil war between haves and have-nots?”

He smiles faintly, then stares at the screen—uncertain whether it’s too bold.

⸻

🧠 Tonal Direction
	•	Fast-paced newsroom realism
	•	Editorial lighting: cool tones with occasional flare from monitors
	•	Alternating between analog (phone, printouts) and digital (AI tools)

⸻

🔁 Reusable Cinematic Elements
	•	“Terminal glow” overlay for screen moments
	•	Voice-over blend (Amanda’s call, Ollie’s thoughts)
	•	Close-up on cursor blinking on headline draft

⸻

🎯 Performance Notes

Ollie – curious, a bit reckless, driven by intuition more than evidence. A mirror of young AI-age reporters.
Ian – dry, efficient, sees potential in Ollie but won’t show it.
Amanda – innocent, formal, unintentionally revealing key info.

Note to AI renderers: Treat this scene as a rhythmic bridge from terror (Scene 01) to system-driven suspicion. The tension is ambient, not explosive.
