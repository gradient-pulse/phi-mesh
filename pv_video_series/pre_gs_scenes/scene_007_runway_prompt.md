**Scene Title:** Rooftop Reflections – Nightfall in Nice

**Prompt for Runway or Veo:**

Generate a cinematic night scene on the rooftop terrace of Hôtel West End in Nice. The camera slowly pans across the Mediterranean coastline shimmering under moonlight. Elegant rooftop lighting casts soft amber tones. We find **Florentine**, alone, leaning on the balustrade, deep in thought, dressed in her formal evening wear from the conference. Her body language is tired yet contemplative. 

Focus on her reflective gaze, partially lit by the rooftop glow, while the city murmurs below. She quietly pages through her marked-up copy of *I, Robot*, her fingers resting on a dog-eared section. Use subtle background noise: waves, distant music, faint traffic.

Insert a flashback overlay (in softer tone or slight vignette style) showing brief flashes from earlier in the day: Morozov's lobby confrontation, Lada’s quick getaway down the Cap-Ferrat path, Florentine’s speech at the reception.

Return to present. Florentine closes the book, looks at the moon, and softly whispers:

> "We are not forecasting the future. We are folding into it."

Final shot: she walks toward the rooftop exit, camera lingering on the open book left behind, gently fluttering in the breeze.
