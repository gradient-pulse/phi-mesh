## Scene Summary
Florentine, finally alone in her hotel room after an overwhelming day, sits on her bed under the soft glow of a bedside lamp. She answers a call from her husband, Jack. The conversation is quiet, tender, and charged with unspoken tension. Outside, unseen by her, a black Mercedes from earlier in the day glides slowly past the hotel entrance before disappearing into the Nice night.

## Visual Description
- Interior: Dimly lit hotel room, warm yellow tones, subtle reflections in the window.
- Florentine is seated on the bed, barefoot, in evening attire but clearly exhausted.
- Cutaway to Jack’s end of the call: a darkened study, lit only by screen light. He listens intently, face unmoving.
- Insert shot: the black Mercedes slowly driving past Hôtel West End outside, the driver invisible.
- Back to Florentine: a slow zoom on her face as she ends the call with a whispered “Jack, please… be careful.”
- Fade to black.

## Camera Directions
- Use close-ups to convey intimacy during the phone call.
- Parallel crosscutting between Florentine and Jack to suggest emotional distance yet shared understanding.
- For the exterior shot of the Mercedes, use a steady wide-angle street view with subtle noir lighting.
- End with a soft dissolve to darkness after Florentine’s closing line.

## Emotional Atmosphere
- Quiet tension beneath love and relief.
- A faint undertone of paranoia — someone is still watching.
- Blend comfort with unease; the viewer should feel both safe and unsettled.

## Notes for AI Director
- Make sure the conversation audio is natural and paced with silence — it’s not exposition, it’s intimacy.
- Lighting should emphasize the hotel room as sanctuary, but break that sense slightly with the outside car shot.
- The Mercedes is not threatening in action, but in implication — it's watching, not moving toward.
