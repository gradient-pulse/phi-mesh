Scene Title: Walk in Bloomsbury

> ⚠️ *Note: This scene was created prior to strict Gradient Syntax mapping and may include inferred transitions or psychological cues. It is preserved here for archival and contrast purposes.*

Location: London – From UCL to Russell Square
Time of Day: Early evening, golden hour light

Visual Direction:
Two women walk side-by-side through historic Bloomsbury. Streets are calm but alive with London’s understated elegance—brick façades, scattered leaves, wrought-iron fences. The atmosphere is reflective. Their pace is unhurried. The camera alternates between wide-angle cityscape shots and intimate close-ups during their dialogue.

Character Guidance:
	•	Florentine Fischer: Carries quiet conviction, her gait measured, her answers grounded in purpose. She’s aware of political undercurrents but stays composed and non-combative.
	•	Lada Morozov: Curious but calculating. Asks probing questions not to attack but to understand—and possibly position herself. Her demeanor is polite but observant, always weighing Florentine’s responses.

Emotional Tone:
Subdued tension wrapped in mutual respect. There is a faint undercurrent of suspicion, yet also admiration. Neither woman fully trusts the other, yet both are aware that they may need each other later.

Key Dialogue (guiding tone, not verbatim):
	•	Lada: “You’ve taken quite a risk developing your model publicly… Do you ever fear it being misused?”
	•	Florentine: “Yes. But I fear irrelevance more.”

Symbolism:
The leaves in Russell Square catch the wind just as their words drift into reflective silence. The parting moment isn’t dramatic—it’s meaningful. A node of divergence. A scene that says: “We’ll meet again, and next time, stakes will be higher.”

Audio Design:
	•	City hum low in the background
	•	Emphasis on footfalls and occasional breeze
	•	Sparse ambient string tones during the final parting shot

Closing Shot:
The women diverge at an old Bloomsbury intersection, one turning left, the other continuing forward. The camera lingers, slowly pulling back as they shrink into the frame—separate vectors from a shared moment.
