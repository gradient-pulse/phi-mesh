chapter: 5
location: British news network studio & remote office in Berlin
time: Late afternoon, London time
characters:
  - Liesel Porsch – German AI-policy advisor, precise, formal, articulate
  - Arthur – Network producer, efficient and supportive
  - Unnamed German official (voice only) – calm and bureaucratic
summary: |
  Liesel Porsch receives a routed call from Berlin while working late at the London office of the international news network. Arthur, a producer, routes the call to her. She picks up with composed clarity. The German official requests a briefing on Professor Fischer’s keynote and whether it aligns with emerging EU AI policy. Liesel affirms that it does, and suggests they prepare a dossier for internal circulation. The conversation is short, professional, and indicative of geopolitical interest building around Florentine’s model.

  - Liesel’s demeanor: calm, intelligent, focused
tone: Subtle, tense undertone beneath professional dialogue
music_cue: Low ambient synth beneath the call, suggesting deeper stakes
transitions:
  from: Scene 22 – Police tip about Jack Keller
  to: Scene 24 – Candace reacts to Thornick's death
notes: |
  This scene deepens the sense that Florentine’s ideas are being studied at high levels of government, especially within Europe. It balances the previous covert surveillance with institutional legitimacy.
