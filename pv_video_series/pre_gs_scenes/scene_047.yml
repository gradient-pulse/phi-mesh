summary: >
  Liesel and Ollie experience the early exhilaration of their new relationship. Their time together is marked by a sequence of "firsts"—first weekend, first stroll, first dinner cooked together. Although their initial meeting was about Florentine’s work, love quickly takes center stage. This scene explores their youthful bond as a light, romantic counterpoint to the more complex themes in the main storyline.

visual_style: >
  Naturalistic, handheld-style shots to capture intimacy and spontaneity. Use golden-hour lighting for outdoor scenes and warm interior tones for their kitchen sequence. A subtle visual contrast to the formal aesthetic of the Keller household.

dialogue_focus: >
  Their conversations are filled with laughter, curiosity about each other’s lives, and gentle teasing. The tone is tender, sincere, and open-ended—intimate without being overly dramatic.

themes:
  - New beginnings
  - Emotional spontaneity
  - Romantic curiosity
  - Youthful idealism

dramatic_purpose: >
  Introduce emotional stakes beyond politics and society. Humanize the narrative with authentic interpersonal relationships. Hint at Ollie’s potential narrative value (e.g., later involvement in Jack’s documentary project).

camera_notes: >
  - Outdoor: use wide shots of London park with slow dolly movement to follow the couple.
  - Indoor: soft focus and over-the-shoulder shots in kitchen scenes.
  - Occasional close-ups of exchanged glances and gestures.

music_cue: >
  Light, modern acoustic guitar or piano. Minimal score, allowing ambient sounds and dialogue to dominate.
