description: |
  Following her stirring reception speech, Florentine engages in informal yet pivotal conversations
  with national delegates. The scene oscillates between genuine intellectual camaraderie and veiled
  geopolitical interests. Meanwhile, Lada quietly observes, sensing the broader chessboard into which
  Florentine is stepping.

  The terrace lights glimmer over the sea as influential attendees gather in clusters. Florentine finds
  herself navigating soft power currents—receiving subtle proposals, invitations, and warnings.

  Lada, blending into the shadows, captures expressions and intentions, mentally noting how societies
  still orbit personalities, prestige, and the art of persuasive uncertainty.

  The scene ends with Florentine staring out over the Mediterranean, whispering to herself:
  “Let the questions speak first.”
