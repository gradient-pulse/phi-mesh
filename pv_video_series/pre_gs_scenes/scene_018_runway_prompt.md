### Prompt for Runway:

Generate a short cinematic scene set in a suburban Starbucks café. The camera opens with a wide shot of the café interior: wood panels, warm lighting, customers chatting, baristas behind the counter. Zoom in to a mid-shot of two middle-aged men seated across from each other at a small table near the window.

One is Jack Keller (clean-shaven, thoughtful, wears a dark coat), the other is Martin Thornick (slightly disheveled, suit jacket off, subtle nervousness in his mannerisms). Their voices are calm, but each line feels like a chess move. Jack asks polite but probing questions about Martin’s recent professional dealings. Martin avoids giving concrete answers.

Cut to close-ups of hand gestures—Martin tapping his coffee cup, Jack folding and unfolding a napkin. The tone is civil, but the subtext is suspicion. Show a short silence between them as background café sounds fill the gap.

Final shot: both men rise slowly, smile faintly, and shake hands, masking unresolved tension. The camera lingers on Martin watching Jack leave, his face unreadable.

**Scene Duration:** ~45 seconds  
**Audio:** Soft ambient café noise, subtle dramatic undercurrent in the score
