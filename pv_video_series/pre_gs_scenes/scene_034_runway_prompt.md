Prompt:
Generate a cinematic scene set in the offices of University College London (UCL), late morning, shortly after a significant phone call. Begin with a soft-lit hallway and a small kitchenette space. Liesel Porsch, appearing joyful and reflective, bumps into Florentine Fischer. Their exchange is warm and sincere—Liesel expresses gratitude for the dinner the night before. The camera captures the calm of human connection.

But as Florentine’s phone buzzes, her demeanor shifts. She excuses herself politely and walks back to her office, the door closing quietly behind her. Use this to introduce an undercurrent of tension.

Cut to Liesel, now alone, carrying her coffee down the corridor. In her office, she looks out the window for a moment, thoughtful. Her phone rings. It’s Oliver Blackwood. Her mood lifts again as she answers with restrained curiosity. Their exchange hints at something more personal behind the professional.

Style should alternate between warmth and subtle suspense. Blend human emotion and bureaucratic realism, without dramatic exaggeration. Interior shots only. Use nuanced lighting, mostly natural with soft shadows. Avoid overacting or stylistic filters. Soundscape should include ambient office noise, but not distract from dialogue.

End the scene with Liesel smiling slightly, setting down her phone, and looking out the window again.
