description: |
  A phone rings at the non-emergency desk of the Metropolitan Police. The operator answers with the usual detached professionalism. On the other end, a heavily distorted voice speaks clearly and slowly: "Martin Thornick had coffee this morning at Starbucks with documentary producer, Jack Keller."

  Before the operator can respond properly or ask for identifying details, the line goes dead.

  The operator hesitates, then logs the call into the system, typing Keller’s name with a brief pause — perhaps sensing the weight of what just occurred.
