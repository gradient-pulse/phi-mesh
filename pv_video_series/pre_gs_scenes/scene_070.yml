characters:
  - Lada Morozova
  - Victor Morozov (voice only)
time: Afternoon
summary: >
  Lada makes a brief but charged call to her estranged father, Victor Morozov, to arrange a meeting. While the tone remains cordial, an undertone of tension suggests unresolved history. This sets in motion a deeper arc revealed in Chapter 12.
dialogue:
  - lada: "Papa, it’s me. Do you have a moment?"
  - victor: "Always, Lada. Are you well?"
  - lada: "I’m fine. I’ll be in Berlin tomorrow. I think it’s time we spoke—properly."
  - victor: "Berlin? That’s unexpected... but welcome."
  - lada: "Can we meet? Somewhere quiet."
  - victor: "Of course. I’ll send you the location."
  - lada: "Thank you. Until then."
  - victor: "Take care, my dear."
notes: >
  This scene must foreshadow tension. Avoid sentimentality. Lada’s calm voice masks an investigative drive. Victor's warmth is strategic. The viewer should sense a larger web being pulled into motion, without knowing its shape yet.
