description: >
  After the unexpected audience at the Chancellery, Florentine and Liesel are escorted to a secondary strategy room inside the Ministry building—a change of venue that reflects the transition from vision to execution. The shift in tone is immediate: less ceremonial, more analytical.

  A select team of senior ministry advisors and agency leads reconvene to debrief and translate insights into operational strategy. Lukas shares updated infrastructure readiness overlays, Julia pushes forward talent acquisition timelines. Clara emphasizes narrative coherence for the public. Rudolf, ever the skeptic, flags regulatory and political latency. Henrik gives a brief but pointed assessment of resistance patterns already surfacing in media and civil society.

  Florentine and Liesel absorb it all, chiming in when needed but also scanning for alignment bottlenecks. The frozen murmuration on the projection screen—arrested mid-flight—becomes a symbolic node-map for this very moment: paused yet full of latent direction.

  Open with close tracking shot of Florentine and Liesel entering from the bright hallway, blinking slightly at the colder fluorescent light. Mid-shot of doors closing behind them. Switch to over-the-shoulder angles as figures gather, exchanging clipped words and prepping visuals. Periodic wide shots show the kinetic group dynamic—standing, pacing, gesturing.

  Insert close-ups: Clara’s raised brow, Rudolf’s tapping pen, Henrik’s steely eyes. Rack-focus toggles between speakers and silent processors.

sound_design: >
  Stylus taps. Tablet swipes. One sharp intake of breath during debate. Background murmur of urgent Berlin traffic filtering in through double-glazed windows. Soft hum from the digital projection. Distant church bell, barely audible.

music_cue: >
  Quiet low string ostinato begins under Lukas’s infrastructure map walkthrough. Crescendo of subtle dissonance as Rudolf voices concern. Return to tonal clarity when Liesel reframes murmuration metaphor. Music tapers off as the group nods in cautious consensus.

mood: >
  Strategically kinetic. The choreography of friction. Ideas clash not to divide, but to crystallize. The air is charged with purpose—what was vision hours ago now begins to solidify.
