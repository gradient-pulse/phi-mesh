## Scene Overview
**Setting**: Interior of a black government car traveling from Hotel Adlon Kempinski to a government ministry building in central Berlin. Early morning light, clear skies. Subtle orchestral music rising.  
**Mood**: Quiet determination, formal tension, the gravity of national stakes.  
**Key Themes**: Readiness, trust, anticipation, symbolic geography, unspoken alliances.

## Characters Present
- **Florentine Fischer** – thoughtful, steady, anchoring the scene with calm urgency.  
- **Liesel Porsch** – quietly focused, inquisitive, attuned to the implications.  
- **Karl** – professional, alert, but discreet.  
- **Unnamed hotel staff** – background, polite.  

## Visual Style
- Interior: Tight, composed framing. Natural daylight filtering through tinted windows.
- Exterior: Glimpses of Berlin’s historic government quarter – Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Bundeskanzleramt – as they pass, conveying national gravity.
- Facial closeups: Florentine and Liesel in silent thought, lips moving as they mentally rehearse.

## Key Shots
1. **Opening shot**: Car doors close. Low-angle exterior as the black Mercedes pulls away from the curb of the Adlon.
2. **Inside the vehicle**: Slow dolly toward Florentine’s face, her expression composed but alert.
3. **Window reflections**: Government buildings passing by, blending with faces inside.
4. **Medium shot**: Karl turns slightly, speaking into frame but not meeting eyes. Professionalism.
5. **Cutaways**: Liesel glancing at her tablet, then folding it quietly.
6. **Final shot**: Car slows near a gated government entrance. Security guards step forward.

## Tone and Sound
- Score: Sparse strings, cello leading. Crescendo as the car nears the government building.
- Dialogue: Measured, formal, slightly hushed – as if being careful not to jinx what’s ahead.
- Ambient: Berlin traffic muffled through the vehicle, subtle AC hum.

## Notes for Animation/FX
- Use shallow depth of field to isolate emotions inside the vehicle.
- Reflect symbolic landmarks subtly in the car windows—suggest without announcing.
- Let silence speak between lines. Florentine and Liesel’s exchange is brief but meaningful.

## Closing Cue
As the car decelerates toward the ministry, the music fades to a low sustained note. Florentine lifts her head slightly, straightens her coat. She’s stepping into history.
