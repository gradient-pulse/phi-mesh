## Format
Cinematic scene, 16:9, color graded for early evening London light.

## Characters
- **Florentine Fischer** – mature, intellectually composed, dressed in a dark green blouse with subtle earrings. Appears slightly weary but focused.
- **Lada Morozov** – confident, early 30s, elegant yet informal, light trench coat, curious gaze, long hair tied loosely back.

## Setting
The Print Room Café at University College London. Cozy interior with warm lighting, old wooden furniture, quiet chatter in the background. Outside light filters through large windows, giving the café a contemplative atmosphere.

## Action
Florentine and Lada walk through the entrance together. They find a small round table by the window. Florentine orders a tea, Lada a cappuccino. They smile, exchange polite remarks, but as the conversation progresses, the tone becomes more watchful. Florentine pauses before answering, Lada leans in slightly, listening intently. There’s a delicate dance of reading each other's intentions without revealing too much.

## Expression and Camera
- Close-up on subtle facial cues: eyebrow raise, slight hand gestures, controlled smiles.
- Use soft shallow focus to isolate the two from the café background, emphasizing the intimacy and veiled tension of their talk.
- Occasional over-the-shoulder shots to show their expressions as each speaks.
- End scene with a medium-wide shot of the two at their table, silent moment as Lada sips her drink, and Florentine stares pensively through the window.

## Mood
Subdued but alert. The conversation is calm on the surface, but there’s a hint of underlying strategic evaluation. Viewers should sense that this is more than just catching up—it’s a moment of quiet calculation.
